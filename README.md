# Next.js OpenAI Doc Search Starter

This starter takes all the `.mdx` files in the `pages` directory and processes them to use as custom context within [OpenAI Text Completion](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/completion) prompts.

## Deploy

Deploy this starter to Vercel. The Supabase integration will automatically set the required environment variables and configure your [Database Schema](./supabase/migrations/20230406025118_init.sql). All you have to do is set your `OPENAI_KEY` and you're ready to go!

## Technical Details

Building your own custom ChatGPT involves four steps:

1. [👷 Build time] Pre-process the knowledge base (your `.mdx` files in your `pages` folder).
2. [👷 Build time] Store embeddings in Postgres with [pgvector](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/pgvector).
3. [🏃 Runtime] Perform vector similarity search to find the content that's relevant to the question.
4. [🏃 Runtime] Inject content into OpenAI GPT-3 text completion prompt and stream response to the client.

## 👷 Build time

Step 1. and 2. happen at build time, e.g. when Vercel builds your Next.js app. During this time the [`generate-embeddings`](./lib/generate-embeddings.ts) script is being executed which performs the following tasks:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Vercel
    participant DB (pgvector)
    participant OpenAI (API)
    loop 1. Pre-process the knowledge base
        Vercel->>Vercel: Chunk .mdx pages into sections
        loop 2. Create & store embeddings
            Vercel->>OpenAI (API): create embedding for page section
            OpenAI (API)->>Vercel: embedding vector(1536)
            Vercel->>DB (pgvector): store embedding for page section
        end
    end
```

In addition to storing the embeddings, this script generates a checksum for each of your `.mdx` files and stores this in another database table to make sure the embeddings are only regenerated when the file has changed.

## 🏃 Runtime

Step 3. and 4. happen at runtime, anytime the user submits a question. When this happens, the following sequence of tasks is performed:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Edge Function
    participant DB (pgvector)
    participant OpenAI (API)
    Client->>Edge Function: { query: lorem ispum }
    critical 3. Perform vector similarity search
        Edge Function->>OpenAI (API): create embedding for query
        OpenAI (API)->>Edge Function: embedding vector(1536)
        Edge Function->>DB (pgvector): vector similarity search
        DB (pgvector)->>Edge Function: relevant docs content
    end
    critical 4. Inject content into prompt
        Edge Function->>OpenAI (API): completion request prompt: query + relevant docs content
        OpenAI (API)-->>Client: text/event-stream: completions response
    end
```

The relevant files for this are the [`SearchDialog` (Client)](./components/SearchDialog.tsx) component and the [`vector-search` (Edge Function)](./pages/api/vector-search.ts).

The initialization of the database, including the setup of the `pgvector` extension is stored in the [`supabase/migrations` folder](./supabase/migrations/) which is automatically applied to your local Postgres instance when running `supabase start`.

## Local Development

### Configuration

- `cp .env.example .env`
- Set your `OPENAI_KEY` in the newly created `.env` file.

### Start Supabase

Make sure you have Docker installed and running locally. Then run

```bash
supabase start
```

### Start the Next.js App

In a new terminal window, run

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Deploy

Deploy this starter to Vercel. The Supabase integration will automatically set the required environment variables and configure your [Database Schema](./supabase/migrations/20230406025118_init.sql). All you have to do is set your `OPENAI_KEY` and you're ready to go!
