1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
Good morning. Good morning. And thanks for coming. Alma loves it. I love it. Charlie

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:16,980
loves it. We're glad to have you here. We're going to make this preliminary before the

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,800
question is very short because we want to get in at least 60 questions half divided

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:30,800
by the audience outside this arena and half from you.

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:45,560
So, I would just like to get right to the directors and the earnings that have been put up on the

6
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,160
web page this morning.

7
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,240
But we'll cover those very fast and we'll get to the questions now.

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:01:03,400
I, when I woke up this morning, I realized that we had a competitive broadcast going

9
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,600
out somewhere in the UK.

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:16,320
And they were celebrating King Charles.

11
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,440
And we've got our own King Charles here today.

12
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:32,680
[APPLAUSE]

13
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,360
And next to him, we have Greg Abel, who's

14
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:44,200
in charge of all the operations except for insurance.

15
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,700
Next.

16
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,240
[APPLAUSE]

17
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:58,420
And next to Greg, we have a man I ran into in 1986,

18
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,540
and has made us look good ever since.

19
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,820
We have a man in charge of insurance, Ajit Jain.

20
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:12,980
[APPLAUSE]

21
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,700
And now we have our directors here in front,

22
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,420
and if they would just stand briefly,

23
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,180
and then I'll go on to the next one,

24
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,700
and they're all here today, first of all,

25
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,700
doing alphabetically.

26
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,860
There's Howard Buffett.

27
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,260
(audience applauding)

28
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,220
There's Suzy Buffett.

29
00:02:41,940 --> 00:03:08,580
Mr. Steve Burke, Ken Schnault, Chris Davis, Sue Decker, Charlotte Geiman, Tom Murphy

30
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:29,500
Jr., Ron Olson, Wally Weiss, and Merrill Whitmer. That's as good as you can get. And there's

31
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,820
one other person I would like to mention before we get on to the earnings that were put on

32
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,980
in the press release this morning.

33
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:47,780
Well, let's see who we have here.

34
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,080
We've got, this is hard to believe.

35
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,340
Can you imagine a name?

36
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,200
Melissa Shapiro Shapiro.

37
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,220
She was, Melissa Shapiro just married another Shapiro,

38
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,860
And she put this whole thing together with no help from me, no help from Charlie,

39
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,820
and a lot of help from the people in the other room.

40
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,500
Melissa.

41
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:22,020
Yeah, it's very easy if you can remember her second name, you can remember her third name.

42
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,780
So, "Mum, this is Shapiro, Shapiro." And with that, I would like to

43
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:35,940
Next move on to the earnings in a couple small slides that explain what we're all about and

44
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:43,700
then we're going to get to the Q&A. And the slide is up behind me. Yeah, there it is. We reported

45
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:53,140
in the first quarter operating earnings a little over eight billion. And when we talk about operating

46
00:04:53,140 --> 00:05:03,460
earnings. We're basically referring to the earnings of Berkshire half a way as generally,

47
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:11,820
well, as required under GAP, excluding, however, capital gains both realized and unrealized.

48
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,460
There's a few other very minor items, but basically we expect to make capital gains

49
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:23,620
over time. Why would we own the stocks otherwise? It doesn't always work out, but overall it

50
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:30,300
works out pretty well over time. But in any day, any quarter, any year, even occasionally

51
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:37,460
over a five-year period, the stock prices move around capriciously. Now we own a lot

52
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:42,180
of other businesses. We consider those stocks businesses. We own a lot of other businesses

53
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,660
where they get consolidated, and they don't move around in value. Now if we had a little

54
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:53,780
bit of Burlington stock outstanding, if we had a little bit of the energy stock trading,

55
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:59,940
those stocks would move around a lot. But the businesses are what count. So the operating

56
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:08,620
earnings, as you'll see in the first quarter, came in at about $8 billion. And I would say

57
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:18,140
that in the general economy, the feedback we get is that I would say perhaps the majority

58
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:27,300
of our businesses will actually report lower earnings this year than last year.

59
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:35,780
In various degrees in the last six months or so, at various times, the businesses have

60
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:42,940
have left the incredible period, which is about as extraordinary as I've seen in business

61
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:49,660
since World War II, with the government that would port out a lot of money to people who

62
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,540
couldn't get goods, it was more extreme in World War II.

63
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,180
But this was extreme this time.

64
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:02,500
And it was just a question of getting goods to the liver and people bought, and they didn't

65
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
wait for sales.

66
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,820
If you couldn't sell them one thing, they would put another thing in the backlog.

67
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,580
It was an extraordinary period.

68
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,820
And that period has ended.

69
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:19,500
It hasn't ended with, you know, it isn't that employment's fell off or off a cliff or anything

70
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:26,780
in the least, but it is a different climate than it was six months ago.

71
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,860
And a number of our managers were surprised.

72
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,820
I'm not mad too much inventory on order,

73
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,940
and then all of a sudden it got delivered,

74
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,700
and people weren't in the same frame of mind as earlier.

75
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,380
And now we'll start having sales

76
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,580
at places where we didn't need to have sales before.

77
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,580
But despite the fact that this year,

78
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,900
I think in general will be slower,

79
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,580
than last year, we actually are situated

80
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,820
so that I would expect, and believe me,

81
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,820
When I say accept, expect, it's nothing is sure.

82
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,660
Nothing's sure tomorrow, nothing's sure next year,

83
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,940
and nothing is ever sure, either in markets

84
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,660
or in business forecasts or anything else.

85
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,140
And we don't pay much attention to markets or forecasts

86
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,020
unless the markets happen to offer

87
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,120
something interesting to do.

88
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,940
But nevertheless, we are positioned in two respects

89
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:33,860
you'll see from this first report. Our investment income is going to be a lot

90
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:41,620
larger this year than last year and that's built in. I mean we had, as you'll

91
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:50,900
see in a minute, we've had $125 billion or so in very short-term investments and

92
00:08:50,900 --> 00:09:00,580
And believe it or not, not that long ago, we were getting four basis points, which is

93
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:07,740
next to nothing, on that $125 billion, which means we were getting $50 million a year.

94
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:14,440
And now the same money, the other just day or day before yesterday, we actually bought

95
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,860
because of some funny twist in the market because of doubts about the deficit ceiling,

96
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:32,540
the debt ceiling. We bought 3 billion of bills at a 5.90. That's 5.9. It was a 5.92. Bond

97
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:41,700
equivalent yield. So we will have what produced us not that long ago on a 12-month basis was

98
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,540
producing 50 million a year, producing something in the area of 5 billion a year. So we're

99
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:53,100
in a position where the investment income is essentially, well it is certain to increase

100
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,020
quite a bit.

101
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:06,780
And insurance underwriting is not, it does not correlate with business activity.

102
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:12,300
It depends on things like hurricanes and earthquakes and other events.

103
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:23,580
So on a prospective basis, on a probability basis, we're likely to have a better year

104
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,100
this year in insurance underwriting than we had last year.

105
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:35,780
It just isn't affected by what you might call the business cycle or what applies to generally

106
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,980
an industry, detailing, you name it.

107
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:49,020
So I would expect, and one massive earthquake or one hurricane that came into just the wrong

108
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:58,060
place would can affect that prediction, but on a probabilistic basis, our insurance looks

109
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,060
better this year.

110
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:05,660
So if you get two of those, two of the elements there of our main elements of earnings that

111
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,860
look like they will swing in our direction, I would expect, but I can't promise, I would

112
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,860
that are operating in earnings will be greater than last year.

113
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,520
And if we'll move to the second slide,

114
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,400
I give you those operating earnings figures

115
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,900
just to give you a overview of what has happened

116
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:35,860
since the pandemic started and often the year before as a base.

117
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,040
And we retain all our earnings, as you know.

118
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,480
So if we're retaining 30 or 35 billion

119
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,440
or whatever it may be a year,

120
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,560
you should expect more operating earnings over time.

121
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,040
I mean, this number should be significantly higher,

122
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,560
five or 10 or 15 years from now,

123
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,920
because we have the advantage of retaining earnings.

124
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,920
And that's what got us to these figures,

125
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,640
because they were essentially nothing when we started.

126
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,520
And they got there by retaining earnings

127
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,920
and we'll keep retaining earnings.

128
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,820
So it's no great triumph if these numbers move up.

129
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,900
And what we hope is that they move up

130
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,180
at a reasonable rate.

131
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,740
Historically, they moved up at an unreasonable rate

132
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,940
sometimes, but we were working with much smaller sums then.

133
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,400
And that can't be repeated with our present capital base.

134
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,420
Because I note there--

135
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,740
I believe it's on this slide.

136
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,580
Let's take a look.

137
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:40,540
Now that'll be, let's see, it's on the,

138
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,980
well on the next, on the next place paid,

139
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,580
let's move to the next slide.

140
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,400
We show that we had on March 31st,

141
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,400
now 500, was it 504 billion of gap net worth.

142
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:05,260
Now what might surprise you is that there's

143
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:11,220
No other company in the United States, no other company that has a number that is that

144
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,220
large.

145
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:19,060
Now, that isn't because we've got the most valuable company in the United States.

146
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,220
Other companies have used their money to repurchase shares.

147
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,140
They could have accumulated 504 billion in gap.

148
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:35,980
Basically, we have more undergap accounting now than any other company in the U.S.

149
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:42,500
And of course, if you measure return on equity, that becomes a very big number to increase

150
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,540
at a rapid rate, but we hope to do so.

151
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,060
Not a rapid rate, a decent rate.

152
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:55,100
And right below that you see something called float.

153
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:09,980
And float is money that is left in our hands somewhat akin, but very importantly different

154
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,060
than a bank deposit.

155
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,060
But you have to pay interest to get a bank deposit.

156
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,380
You have to pay more interest these days, and you have to run a bank and do a lot of

157
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,780
things.

158
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:27,900
And basically, this is money that represents unpaid losses at this time.

159
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,720
You get paid in advance in insurance.

160
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:40,520
So what shows up as a net liability on our balance sheet is, gives us funds to exercise

161
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:46,000
with an amount of discretion that no other insurance company that I know of in the world

162
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,960
and joy just because we have so much net worth.

163
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:57,480
And our float now comes to $165 billion, and the man sitting on the far left is responsible

164
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:07,040
for moving that number up from a piton in 1986 to this incredible figure, which in most

165
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,280
years, practically all years, hasn't cost us anything.

166
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:20,760
So it's like having a bank with no employees, no interest, and no ability to withdraw the

167
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:26,720
money in a hurry that we have working for us.

168
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:34,440
And it's a very valuable asset that shows up as a liability.

169
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:49,260
And Ajit is responsible for building up this treasure, which has been done by out-competing

170
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,260
insurance companies all over the world.

171
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:57,340
And now a number of our insurance companies, in turn, are run by talented managers who

172
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,340
who contributed one way or another.

173
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:05,020
Start with Geico, the beginning of my career,

174
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:09,280
and that float.

175
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,180
If you think about it, just think of a balance sheet.

176
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,700
You've got liabilities here, and you've got assets over here,

177
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,380
and the liability side finances the asset side.

178
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,660
It's very simple.

179
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,020
And stockholders' equity finances it,

180
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,460
long-term debt finances it, and so on.

181
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:30,160
But stockholders' equity is very expensive in a real sense.

182
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,660
Long term debt has been cheap for a while, but it can get expensive and it can also become

183
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:41,080
due eventually and it may not be available.

184
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:47,920
But float is another item that shows, it's a liability, but it hasn't cost us anything

185
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,200
And it can't disappear in a hurry.

186
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,520
And it finances the asset side in the same way

187
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,440
as stockholders' equity.

188
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,000
And nobody else thinks of it much that way,

189
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,320
but we've always thought of it that way,

190
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,600
and it's built up over time.

191
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,280
So I show at the bottom what's happened with cash

192
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,040
and treasury bills through March 31st.

193
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,440
And I will tell you that in the month of April,

194
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:22,000
We probably added about $7 billion to that factor.

195
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,360
Not part of that is because we didn't buy as much stock because that reduces cash and

196
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,360
treasury bills.

197
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,640
We bought about $400 million worth of stock in the month of April.

198
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,080
That's a minus in terms of cash available.

199
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:47,040
And we, however, sold net some stock which produced maybe $4 billion.

200
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,960
And of course we had operating earnings, probably $2.5 billion or something in that area.

201
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:58,000
My guess is we probably increased our cash in Treasuryables, $6 billion or $7 billion

202
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,080
in the month.

203
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,880
And I just want to give you a feel for how the cash flows at Berkshire.

204
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,860
And then if we move to the final,

205
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,360
I think it's the final one, next to the last one.

206
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:18,440
No, I think it is the last one, let's see, is the fourth.

207
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,200
Yeah, is this, we should have the one up there,

208
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,240
class A equivalent shares outstanding.

209
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,560
And you'll notice that every year,

210
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,000
the number of our shares go down.

211
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,240
So if we own more businesses,

212
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,680
and the businesses make more money,

213
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,560
Your share, as shareholders, as owners of Berkshire,

214
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,280
increases every year without you laying out any money.

215
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,200
Now you're laying out the alternative

216
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,640
which you could receive in dividends,

217
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,880
but the reason we got into where we are

218
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,840
is because we kept the money.

219
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,840
We did pay a dividend in 1967, 10 cents a share.

220
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,480
It was a terrible mistake.

221
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,160
And I always tell people that I'd left for the men's room

222
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,360
and the directors voted while I was going.

223
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,120
But that isn't true.

224
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,640
I was there.

225
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,360
I confess.

226
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,200
But we very invested and that's produced the 500 billion

227
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,560
plus of shareholders' equity and the 30 billion plus

228
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,600
of operating earnings.

229
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,200
And we'll continue to follow that policy

230
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,080
because it makes a great deal of sense.

231
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:35,360
And with that, I think we've taken care of the preliminaries.

232
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:43,760
You can study that the 10Q is on the web page.

233
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,280
And if you have a week or two vacation,

234
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,120
you could spend it reading the 10Q.

235
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,280
But that is the essence of Berkshire.

236
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,280
And with that, I will start with Becky Quick.

237
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:02,480
And we will alternate between Becky and the audience,

238
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,800
and her questions have come in from all over the country.

239
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,360
And I believe you identified the center.

240
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,400
And go to it, Becky.

241
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,480
Thanks, Warren.

242
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,240
The first question comes in from Randy Jeffs in Irvine,

243
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,160
California.

244
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,040
And his question is, if Silicon Valley Bank's deposit had not

245
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,040
been fully covered, what do you think the economic consequences

246
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,160
would have been to the nation?

247
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,440
Well, I would just simply say it would have been catastrophic.

248
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,920
And that's why they were covered.

249
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:38,120
And even though the FDIC limit is $250,000,

250
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,320
that's the way the statute reads.

251
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,880
But that is not the way the US is going to behave any more

252
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,080
than they're going to let the Dutch ceiling cause the world

253
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,280
to go into turmoil.

254
00:20:51,280 --> 00:21:04,080
And they, well they just, I can't imagine anybody in the administration, in the Congress,

255
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,160
in the Federal Reserve, whatever it may have been, FDIC.

256
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,520
I can't imagine anybody saying, I'd like to be the one on television tomorrow and explain

257
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:21,640
the American public while we're keeping only $250,000 insured, and we're going to start

258
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,760
around every bank in the country and disrupt the world financial system.

259
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,000
So I think it was inevitable.

260
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,040
Charlie, do you have any?

261
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,800
No, I have nothing to add.

262
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Okay, well, incidentally, I should mention this now.

263
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Ajit and Greg will be here in the morning session, which ends at noon.

264
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,100
And so it's got questions to direct to them.

265
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,900
The time to do it is in the first half of the show.

266
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:58,500
And then after lunch, it'll just, Charlie and I will be back.

267
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,000
OK. Area one.

268
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,900
Hi, Nerov Patel, Harrell, Massachusetts.

269
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:14,580
Mr. Buffett, Mr. Munger, it seems like you found the sweet spot between being too conservative

270
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,620
and too aggressive as investors.

271
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:22,140
Do you ever make bad investment decisions because of your emotions, and what do you

272
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,140
do to try to keep that from happening?

273
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:32,620
Well, we make bad investment decisions.

274
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:38,860
plenty of times I make more than Charlie because I like to think it's because I make more decisions,

275
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:51,180
but probably more batting average is worse. But I can't recall any time in the history of Berkshire

276
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:59,900
we made an emotional decision. I know the movie had Jamie Lee in there, but that was for laughs.

277
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:09,040
I mean, Jamie Lee, she's good, but she's not good enough to get me or Charlie to make

278
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:13,100
an emotional decision.

279
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:22,060
Charlie, I'm sure you have something to add on that.

280
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:29,060
Well, it's a different movie that is shown at most corporate meetings.

281
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,060
Yeah.

282
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,060
But have we ever made an emotional decision?

283
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,060
No.

284
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:39,060
That's in business we're talking about.

285
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,060
Yeah.

286
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:45,820
No, you don't want to be a no emotion person in all of your life, but you definitely want

287
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:53,220
be no emotion person in making an investment or business decision.

288
00:23:53,220 --> 00:24:00,220
You can argue that.

289
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:08,500
We probably, I would say that we've made an emotional decision perhaps, and when a manager

290
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,860
has been with us for some period.

291
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:23,260
And we have ignored the fact that perhaps they weren't quite what they were earlier.

292
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:29,060
But our businesses are so good that they've run better sometimes.

293
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:38,340
When I've talked about Westco, for example, the wonderful Louisville incentive, it ran

294
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,180
on automatic pilot for a while.

295
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:47,000
I don't think we suffered by it, but you can argue that if Charlie and I hadn't liked

296
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,300
Louis as much as we did, we might have spotted it a little bit earlier, but I don't think

297
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,260
it made any difference in the results.

298
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,260
Would you agree with that, Charlie?

299
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,380
Yeah, yeah, you'd be totally with it.

300
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:04,980
And I'm glad we behaved the way we did at Westco.

301
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:11,060
By the way, we bought the thing for a few tens of millions and it became worth two or three

302
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,060
billion.

303
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:20,100
Yeah, that wasn't common in the savings and loan businesses, you may have noticed.

304
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:24,980
They really went crazy in that industry and we had a wonderful guy in Louis.

305
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,980
We didn't go crazy.

306
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,460
Yeah, we didn't go crazy.

307
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,460
Okay.

308
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,460
Becky?

309
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,660
Okay, Maggie?

310
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,700
This question comes from Ben Nol in Minneapolis.

311
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,660
He says he's a Berkshire shareholder of three decades, and he's attended many Berkshire

312
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,660
meetings.

313
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,260
He's here again this year.

314
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,540
And this is addressed to Ajit and Greg.

315
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:50,420
He says, "Last year I asked you about how GEICO and BNSF appeared to lose ground to

316
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,100
their leading competitors.

317
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,700
GEICO on Telematics and BNSF on precision-scheduled railroading.

318
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:01,020
Ajit, you responded by saying how you expected GEICO to make progress in a year or two.

319
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,620
you spoke about your pride in BNSF, but you didn't directly address the threat of precision

320
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:10,660
scheduled railroading. Will each of you please provide perspective on these competitive challenges

321
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:16,740
and our company's strategies to address them?

322
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:26,260
In terms of GEICO and telematics, let me make the observation that GEICO has certainly taken

323
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:32,420
the bull by the horns and has made rapid strides in terms of trying to bridge the gap in terms

324
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,460
of telematics and its competitors.

325
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:44,660
They have now reached a point where on all new business, close to 90 percent has a telematics

326
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,660
input to the pricing decision.

327
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:52,980
Unfortunately less than half of that is being taken up by the policy holders.

328
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:58,300
The other point I want to make is even though we have made improvements in terms of bridging

329
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:05,500
the gap on telematics, we still haven't started to realize the true benefit and the real culprit

330
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,340
of the bottleneck is technology.

331
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,540
Geico's technology needs a lot more work than I thought it did.

332
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:17,500
It has more than 500, actually more than 600 legacy systems that don't really talk to each

333
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:24,380
other and we are trying to compress them to no more than 15, 16 systems that all talk to

334
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,380
each other.

335
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,460
That's a monumental challenge and because of that, even though we have made improvements

336
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:36,340
in telematics, we still have a long way to go because of technology.

337
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:40,620
Because of that and because of the whole issue more broadly in terms of matching rate to

338
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,300
risk, GEICO is still work in progress.

339
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:48,420
I don't know if any of you had a chance to look at the first quarter results, but Gaiko

340
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:53,540
has had a very good first quarter coming in at a combined ratio of 93 and change, which

341
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:57,500
means a margin of six and change.

342
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,500
Even though that's very good, it's not something we can take to the bank because there are

343
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,900
two unusual items that contributed to it.

344
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,780
Firstly, we've had what is called prior year reserve releases.

345
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,940
We've reduced reserves for the previous years and that contributed to it.

346
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,420
And secondly, every year the first quarter tends to be a seasonally good quarter for

347
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,300
auto insurance writers.

348
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:25,460
So if you adjust those two factors, my guess is the end of the year, Greiko will end up

349
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:30,780
with a combined ratio just south of 100 as opposed to the target they're shooting for

350
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,700
is 96.

351
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:38,860
I hope they reach the target of 96 by the end of next year.

352
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:43,240
But instead of getting too excited about it, I think it's important to realize that even

353
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:49,240
if we reach 96, it will come at the expense of having lost policy holders.

354
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,080
There is a trade-off between profitability and growth.

355
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:59,040
And clearly we are going to emphasize profitability and not growth, and that will come at the

356
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,080
expense of policy holders.

357
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,640
So it will not be until two years from now that we'll be back on track fighting the battles

358
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,700
on both the profitability and the growth front.

359
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,440
>> Great.

360
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,840
>> Yeah.

361
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,320
>> Moving to BNSF, I'll start again

362
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,920
by expressing great pride in the BNSF team.

363
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,520
We have an exceptional group of led by Katie and her managers

364
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,960
that show up every day to do great work on the railroad.

365
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,120
At the same time, they would be the first to acknowledge there's more

366
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,400
to be done there.

367
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,120
the specific reference to precision, scheduled railroading,

368
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,920
the other large railroad, class A, other railroads

369
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,120
in the U.S. follow that, and including the two in Canada.

370
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,000
We're well aware of what they're doing,

371
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,280
and obviously pay close attention

372
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,400
to their operating metrics.

373
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,040
And our team strives every day to be more efficient, obviously.

374
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,040
I would say we balance it with the needs of our customers.

375
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:10,320
If I look back to pre-2022, so we look at the three-year period of 2019, 2020, 2021,

376
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:18,880
the BNSF team made significant progress on their efficiencies and delivering overall value back to

377
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,080
the shareholders and to their customers, and at the same time maintaining a very safe railroad

378
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,840
for our employees. So we're making excellent progress. That didn't stop last year. They made

379
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:35,520
great progress again the reality in 2022 as we did go through a period of time where we had to

380
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:42,400
call it reset the railroad. We came out of the pandemic there were the supply challenges. We

381
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:48,560
had certain other labor issues and other things going on at the port and the reality is our team

382
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:54,480
prioritized getting the railroad back in place for the long term. Not a short-term focus on hitting

383
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:01,440
certain operating metrics in 2022. We're well aware of where we were relative to those metrics,

384
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,600
but the real focus was to get the railroad reset in a safe manner such that we could deliver long

385
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:13,760
term value and long term service to our customers. And that's really what we'll continue to see with

386
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,200
that team. There'll be continual progress. There'll be years where it's not as quickly or even we go

387
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:26,000
backwards, but over the long term we'll be very, we'll see exceptional results from that

388
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,860
team and couldn't be more proud that we have that asset.

389
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,860
Thank you.

390
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:38,320
I would just, well he deserves, but both of them deserve applause.

391
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:48,360
I would like to add one thing.

392
00:31:48,360 --> 00:32:02,280
He, at GEICO, Todd Combs was a jeep's choice, my choice, to go back to GEICO to work on

393
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:10,040
the problem of matching rate to risk, which is what insurance is all about.

394
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:18,140
And he arrived with exquisite timing right before the pandemic broke out and all kinds

395
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,180
of things changed.

396
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:29,540
But Todd is doing a wonderful job at Geico and he works closely with the Jeep because

397
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,340
he still has a home in Omaha.

398
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,620
He comes back here and we get together on the weekend sometimes too.

399
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:44,700
So that's been a remarkable accomplishment under difficult circumstances.

400
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:52,560
He's not all the way home, but he's made a very, very big change in multiple ways at

401
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,560
GEICO.

402
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:59,500
And then one other thing I would like to mention, there have been a lot of public companies

403
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:05,740
created in the last decade thereabouts in insurance.

404
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:13,140
And there's none of them that we would like to own.

405
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:18,100
And they always started out in their perspective saying this is a tech company, not an insurance

406
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,100
company.

407
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,900
Of course, they're in a tech company.

408
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:28,220
Everybody's, whether they're in insurance or a lot of other places, are using the facility,

409
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:33,860
but you still have to properly match rate to risk.

410
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:40,140
They invariably have reported the huge losses, they've eaten up capital, but there's been

411
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,420
one company that nobody has generally heard of.

412
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:50,340
There's only been one that I know of, a company started in the last 10 years that has been

413
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:57,860
an overwhelming success, and that's a company that Ajit and four people who joined with

414
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:04,860
them set to develop a new business. It's called Berkshire Hathaway Specialty. It now has,

415
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:08,700
what's the float? A Jeep?

416
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,740
>> Coming up to 12 billion.

417
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:17,740
>> Yeah. We've built more float than probably all these companies combined. We've now, it's

418
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:25,740
cost us essentially nothing in terms of an underwriting loss. The four people have turned

419
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,420
I don't know, 1500 around the world.

420
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:36,700
We took on the whole industry and we brought some unique talent

421
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,100
and the four people that came and now have,

422
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,860
like I said, 1500 or so worldwide.

423
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:48,580
And we brought capital and we brought capabilities

424
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,300
that really only Berkshire could supply.

425
00:34:51,300 --> 00:35:00,820
So it was the combination of brains and talent and energy and money.

426
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:06,860
And no one has really successfully entered this space.

427
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,700
Plenty of people in this space who didn't like us coming.

428
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,740
And we did it without it.

429
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,580
It cost us a dime of entry.

430
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:22,260
And it's been unmatched by any of the companies that went public.

431
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,580
And people have seen us do it, but they can't duplicate it.

432
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,580
And that's what Ajit has created.

433
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,580
And Peter East would have led this group, Berkshire Hathaway especially.

434
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,460
And it's just remarkable.

435
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,620
So anyway, with that, let's go on.

436
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:46,620
Give him a hand for that.

437
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:55,620
Okay, let's go to section two.

438
00:35:55,620 --> 00:36:00,620
Hi, Charlie. I'm Eloran. I'm Karen here from Singapore.

439
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:05,620
I'm glad you got that in.

440
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,620
Your priorities are right.

441
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:16,820
>> Yes, I have a question on AI and robotics. Here's my question. As AI and robotics continue

442
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:24,580
to advance, what do you believe will be the positive and negative impact of this technology

443
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:31,260
on both the stocks market and society as a whole? And are there any specific industries

444
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:39,840
and companies that you believe will be most impacted.

445
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,400
>> Karen, I thank you for asking Charlie that question.

446
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:51,360
[ Laughter ]

447
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,160
>> Hello.

448
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,120
If you went into BYD's factories in China,

449
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:04,360
You would see robotics going in at an unbelievable rate.

450
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:09,080
So we're going to see a lot more robotics in the world.

451
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,240
I am personally skeptical of some of the hype

452
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,200
that is going into artificial intelligence.

453
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,680
I think old-fashioned intelligence works pretty well.

454
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,640
[APPLAUSE]

455
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:32,320
There won't be anything in AI that replaces the gene.

456
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,080
State that unqualifiedly.

457
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,660
They can do amazing things.

458
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:47,640
Bill Gates brought me out of the latest,

459
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,840
maybe not the latest version,

460
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,800
but one he thought maybe I could handle,

461
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,480
which has to be careful with me

462
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,260
in terms of leading me too fast.

463
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,700
And it did these remarkable things.

464
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,100
It didn't, but it couldn't tell jokes.

465
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,180
Bill told me that ahead of time and it prepared me.

466
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,340
And it just isn't there.

467
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:15,660
But, you know, things like checking all the legal opinions, you know, since the beginning

468
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,380
of time and everything and eliminating all the...

469
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,220
I mean, it can do all kinds of things.

470
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:29,340
And when something can do all kinds of things, I get a little bit worried.

471
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,940
And because I know we won't be able to uninvent it.

472
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:45,100
And you know, we did invent for very, very good reason the atom bomb in World War II.

473
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:50,980
And it was enormously important that we did so.

474
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:58,740
But is it good for the next 200 years of the world that the ability to do so has been unleashed?

475
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,500
We didn't have any choice.

476
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:08,660
But when you start something, well, Einstein said after the atom bomb, he said, "This has

477
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:12,180
changed everything in the world except how men think."

478
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:18,180
And I would say the same thing may, not the same thing.

479
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,940
I don't mean that, but I mean, with AI,

480
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:28,500
it can change everything in the world, except

481
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,540
how men think and behave.

482
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:35,140
And that's a big step to take.

483
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:39,100
It's a good question, and it's the best answer we can give.

484
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:39,940
Becky?

485
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,260
- This question comes from Tom Seymour.

486
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,540
He says, "The first sentence of a recent

487
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:51,600
Financial Times article read, "Charlie Munger has warned of a brewing storm in the U.S.

488
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:57,180
commercial property market with American banks full of what he said were bad loans as property

489
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,860
prices fall.

490
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,140
Please elaborate on what's going on in commercial real estate.

491
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:07,500
How bad will the losses be and what sectors or geographies look particularly bad?

492
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,100
I'll just add an addendum from another viewer who wrote in and wanted to know if Berkshire

493
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:16,100
would be more active in commercial real estate as a result?

494
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:26,320
Well, Berkshire has never been very active in commercial real estate.

495
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,380
It works better for taxable investors than it does for corporations taxed away Berkshire

496
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,540
is.

497
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:41,060
So I don't anticipate huge effects on Berkshire, but I do think that the hollowing out of the

498
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:46,100
of the downtowns in the United States and elsewhere in the world is going to be quite

499
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,980
significant and quite unpleasant.

500
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:55,580
I think the country will get through it all right, but as they say, it will often involve

501
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,580
a different set of owners.

502
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:01,980
Yeah, and the buildings don't go away, but-

503
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,980
The owners do.

504
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:08,780
But most people like to buy with non-recourse in real estate.

505
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:15,020
And one time I asked Charlie, there was some real estate guy we were talking to him,

506
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:19,660
and how do they decide how much they can-- a building like this is worth?

507
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:24,700
And the answer is, it's whatever they can borrow without signing their name.

508
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:31,500
And if you look at real estate generally, you'll understand what the phenomenon is happening.

509
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:41,000
if you remind yourself that that's the attitude of most people that have become big in the

510
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:49,200
real estate business. And it does mean that the lenders are the ones that get the property.

511
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,920
And of course they don't want the property usually. So the real estate operator counts

512
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:02,040
on negotiating with them and the banks tend to extend and pretend.

513
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:08,760
There's all kinds of activities that arrive out of commercial real estate development,

514
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,560
which occurs on a big scale.

515
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,840
But it all has consequences.

516
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:20,880
And I think we're about, well, we are starting to see the consequences of people who could

517
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,000
borrow it two and a half percent and find out it doesn't work at current rates and they

518
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,520
handed it back to somebody that gave them all the money they needed to build it.

519
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,120
Charlie's had more experience than really.

520
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,160
Charlie got it started in real estate though.

521
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,360
I mean Charlie, Charlie.

522
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:44,600
Yeah, so it's difficult.

523
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,560
I like what we do better.

524
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:54,860
Well, as Charlie once said to me when I was leaving his house a few months ago, I was

525
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:59,720
busy and we talked for a couple of hours and I said to Charlie as I left, I just, I wasn't

526
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,720
anybody else in the house.

527
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,080
I said, except one daughter.

528
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:09,800
And I said, Charlie, I'll just keep doing what we've been doing.

529
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,800
And Charlie said, without looking up or pausing a second, he said, that's all you know how

530
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,800
to do, Warren.

531
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,280
[LAUGHTER]

532
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,720
He was right, too.

533
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,240
Station three, is it?

534
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,480
Hi.

535
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,360
My name is Zialo Z. I'm from Santa Clara, California.

536
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,960
And my question is to Charlie and Warren.

537
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,320
Given the rise of disruptive technologies that

538
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,640
can improve productivity significantly and AI being

539
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,160
one of them, how do you envision

540
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:52,140
the future of value investing in this new era and what adaptations or new

541
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:56,660
principles do you think investors should adopt and any recommendations for

542
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:02,940
investors to remain successful in this rapid changing landscape. Thank you.

543
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:09,100
Well I'm glad to take that one. I think value investors are going to have a

544
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:15,940
harder time now that there's so many of them competing for a diminished bunch of

545
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:23,180
opportunities. So my advice to value investors is to get used to making less.

546
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:29,460
And Charlie was been telling me the same thing the whole time we've known each other.

547
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,060
We get along wonderfully because...

548
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,860
We are making less.

549
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:37,580
Oh well, but that's mostly I think it's because of the larger...

550
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,060
We did better when we were younger.

551
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:42,220
We never thought we could manage $508 billion.

552
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,260
No, you never thought that.

553
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:51,180
But I would argue that there's going

554
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,300
to be plenty of opportunities.

555
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,300
And part of the reason they're requiring

556
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,260
you to be plenty of opportunities,

557
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,500
the tech doesn't make any difference or any of that.

558
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:03,940
I mean, if you look at how the world changed in the years,

559
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:07,340
since 1942, when I started, you'd say, well,

560
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,740
how does a kid that doesn't know anything

561
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:12,220
about airplanes, it doesn't know anything about engines and cars, it doesn't know anything

562
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,940
about electricity and all that.

563
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,700
But that's easy, isn't it?

564
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,700
That's not the...

565
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,100
The world's changing, doesn't it?

566
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,620
Or new things coming along don't take away the opportunities.

567
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:28,580
What gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things.

568
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:34,060
And it's that...

569
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:42,360
And I would say that, well, the 58 years we've been running Berkshire, I would say there's

570
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:49,740
been a great increase in the number of people doing dumb things, and they do big dumb things.

571
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:54,580
And the reason they do it to some extent is because they can get money from other people

572
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:57,780
so much easier than when we started.

573
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:04,280
So you could start 10 or 15 dumb insurance companies in the last 10 years and you could

574
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:11,440
become rich if you were adroit at it, whether the business exceeded or not and the underwriters

575
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,860
got paid and the lawyers got paid.

576
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:22,900
And that creates, if that's done on a large scale, which it couldn't be done 58 years

577
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:28,980
ago, you couldn't get the money to do some of the dumb things that we wanted to do,

578
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:29,980
fortunately.

579
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:42,740
And so I think that investing has disappeared so much from this huge capitalistic market

580
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:48,060
that anybody can play in, but that the big money is in selling other people ideas that

581
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:51,560
that isn't outperforming, in outperforming.

582
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:56,560
And I think that, I think if you don't run too much money,

583
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:02,140
which we do, but if you're running small amounts of money,

584
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:05,940
I think the opportunities will be greater,

585
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,060
but then Charlie and I will always differ

586
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,400
on this subject.

587
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,140
He likes to tell me how gloomy the world is,

588
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,740
and I like to tell him we'll find something.

589
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:17,740
And so far we've both been kind of right.

590
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:20,460
Charlie, wouldn't you?

591
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,780
We're budging it, Sean, that or not.

592
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:33,500
There is so much money now in the hands of so many smart people,

593
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,220
all trying to outsmart one another

594
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:40,020
and out-promote one another, getting more money out of other people.

595
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:47,140
And it's a radically different world from the world we started in.

596
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:50,260
And I suppose it will have its opportunities,

597
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:54,660
but it's also going to have some unpleasant episodes.

598
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:59,660
>> But they're trying to outsmart each other in arenas.

599
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:01,020
You don't have to play.

600
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:04,100
I mean, if you look at that government bond market,

601
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,620
the Treasury Bill market, I mean, you've got this one bill

602
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,900
that's out of line with the others.

603
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,660
We bought over $3 billion of it the other day.

604
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:23,480
And but those are people the world is overwhelmingly short term focused and if you go to an investor

605
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:28,860
relations call they're all trying to figure out how to fill out a sheet to show the earnings

606
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:33,480
for the year and the management is interested in feeding them expectations that will slightly

607
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,480
be beaten.

608
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,600
I mean that that is a world that's made to order for anybody that's trying to think

609
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:44,280
about what you do that should work over five or ten or twenty years.

610
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:53,800
And I just think that I would love to be born today and go out with not too much money and

611
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:58,360
hopefully turn it into a lot of money.

612
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,800
And Charlie would too actually.

613
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,840
He would find something to do.

614
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,120
I will just guarantee you.

615
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,920
And it wouldn't be exactly the same as before.

616
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,420
And he would have a big, big, big pile.

617
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:16,920
I would not like the thrill of losing my big pile into a small pile.

618
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:22,920
I like my big pile just the way it is.

619
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,240
Well, I like.

620
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,240
We agree on that incident.

621
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,240
Like, okay.

622
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,240
Yes, we do.

623
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:31,920
You're one of the most extreme lovers of the big pile.

624
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,040
Becky?

625
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,980
This question is for both Warren and Ege.

626
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:41,760
It comes from Jason Ploner in Livingston, New Jersey.

627
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:47,280
He says, "In 2016, you entered into a very unique transaction with AIG, where you assumed

628
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,920
up to $20 billion of liabilities in exchange for about $10 billion upfront.

629
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,880
Can you please provide us with an update on this transaction in light of the increase

630
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,380
in interest rates?"

631
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:02,500
And then in Tokyo, just a few weeks ago, you talked about the risks of banks with assets

632
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,440
that were susceptible to rising interest rates.

633
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,980
Any insight as to how Berkshire liabilities are susceptible to duration would be appreciated.

634
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,420
Is that directed to Ajit or me?

635
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,420
Both.

636
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,420
Okay.

637
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,420
Let me introduce it to my one thing.

638
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,780
Well, Ajit is the key to this.

639
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,860
He's the one that put the deal together.

640
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:27,580
But we got handed 10 billion, we'll say.

641
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:32,380
But we weren't restricted to putting that into bonds.

642
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:41,220
So what the exact interest rates affect us to some degree maybe in terms of the terms

643
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:46,780
of the deal we did with AIG or anybody we would do a similar deal with like that.

644
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:50,780
But we don't have to put it in matching bonds or anything of the sort.

645
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:55,860
It goes into a general pool of assets, which we manage in the assets.

646
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:58,480
You know, well the liquid assets now are

647
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:03,540
130 billion plus and but it goes in so it you know it

648
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:08,240
It is not set aside in some little compartment like people like to think

649
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:15,140
Now any any any other insurance no other insurance company could do it, but they can't think that way

650
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:20,960
They aren't even used to thinking that way, but they can't think that way because they don't have our our balance sheet

651
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,580
We account for 26% or something like that of the net worth of all property

652
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,380
casually companies in the United States.

653
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:39,320
So, so far, uh, the payment that we have had to make have run modestly.

654
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:43,540
And Ajit will correct me on this if I'm wrong, because he paid a lot of attention

655
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:50,260
to the, the, the, the amount we have had to pay has run slightly below the

656
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:56,100
out we anticipated having to pay in terms of our share of the losses.

657
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,980
But it served AIG's purposes.

658
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:04,820
It came to us with -- or we were in a unique position.

659
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:11,020
There's nobody else that was able to write that, just like when we took on the Lloyds.

660
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:18,180
I mean, Lloyds said there was no choice other than Berkshire Hathaway when they essentially

661
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:27,780
resuscitated their market by laying off a lot of liabilities on Berkshire Hathaway.

662
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:31,940
So we won't see those deals very often.

663
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:36,500
If they're for 500 million or something like that, somebody else will go in there and offer

664
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,000
more money.

665
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,120
Everybody's looking for money on Wall Street.

666
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:46,420
But if they start talking with a deal like the AIG deal, there isn't any other stop.

667
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:50,420
Correct me on all my numbers there, Ajit.

668
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:58,420
No, one way to look at how the deal is performing since we did the deal is at the point in time

669
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:05,420
when we did the deal, we had made certain projections of how much we will pay out each year.

670
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:11,420
And what we do is monitor what the actual payments are since the inception of the deal

671
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:15,420
and how does that compare with what we expected to pay out.

672
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:19,220
One mentioned these two numbers are very close to each other.

673
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:25,820
More specifically, the actual payouts are 96% of what we had projected to payout at this

674
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:29,660
point in time, which is good but not great.

675
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,820
We are still ahead of the curve.

676
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:37,620
If we do end up paying out less than what we projected, not only would we have borrowed

677
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:42,620
money at a very attractive rate, meaning less than 4%, significantly less than 4%.

678
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:49,240
In addition to that, we would have made a fee which in 2015 dollars would be a million

679
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,240
dollars.

680
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:54,360
So we would have borrowed money at less than 4% and we would have made a million dollar

681
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:58,500
fee which is slightly more than what we were expecting to do.

682
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,100
So Net-Net, we're very happy with the deal.

683
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,100
We're happy we did it.

684
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,860
But the game is not over.

685
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:08,800
The total liabilities are coming down the pike every second day.

686
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,800
So I'm cautiously optimistic that the deal will work out better than what we expected

687
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,800
it to work out.

688
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:22,480
Well, the really interesting thing is that within Berkshire, the casualty insurance companies

689
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:30,800
have four times as much stockholder capital behind each dollar of premium volume.

690
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,080
Four times normal.

691
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,280
And of course we see the big deals.

692
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:42,200
But would you trust if you had a big liability you wanted to dump on somebody?

693
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:53,200
And we have 25 or a billion or more coming in from things other than insurance uncorrelated

694
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,260
to insurance every year with no obligations.

695
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:57,260
We don't pay dividends.

696
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:02,960
If you pay dividends and you cut your dividend, try going around trying to write insurance

697
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:03,960
the next day.

698
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,800
And it's a business where the people are counting on you to pay.

699
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:15,080
And when we take that $10 billion, we don't agree to put it in five-year bonds and ten-year

700
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,080
bonds.

701
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,600
We don't even think that way.

702
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:23,040
And the people that do business with us know that they have somebody like nobody else on

703
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:28,600
those -- that's going to be able to pay $10 billion, you know, no matter what happens to

704
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,520
the economy.

705
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,720
So it's not only the presence of enormous strength in insurance companies, it's the

706
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:39,080
fact we got all these earnings that essentially come in every month.

707
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,640
And we don't have a lot of debt.

708
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:46,420
I mean, we have debt at the railroad and the energy level.

709
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:53,000
But in terms of the rest of the operation, and we don't guarantee that debt, but it's

710
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,720
plenty good.

711
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:03,820
And it's -- this isn't just another Berkshire, and the Jeep recognizes that when he's negotiating.

712
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:06,740
So does the other party, if the sums are big enough.

713
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:11,340
There's all kinds of people that love to get $500 million or $300 million, and they can

714
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:16,420
-- they may think in terms of lending it out because that's what their insurance companies

715
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:21,540
can do at a somewhat higher rate, but that is not a game we play in, and we don't have

716
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,900
any interest in playing in them.

717
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:27,740
Okay, station four.

718
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:34,160
Hello, I'm Marvin Blum, an estate planning lawyer from Fort Worth, Texas, home to many

719
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,700
of your companies.

720
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:43,460
In fact, Warren, I met you at the memorial for our beloved Paul Andrews, who was manager

721
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:46,460
of TTI.

722
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:52,540
I'd like to get your thoughts on a widespread problem in the world of estate planning, and

723
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:58,900
And that's the failure of most parents to prepare the next generation for the inheritance

724
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,380
coming their way.

725
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:08,380
In particular, if the estate includes a family business, most parents fail to do business

726
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:16,500
succession planning to plan for who will run the business on the day when, not if, the

727
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,340
founder is no longer there to run it.

728
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:28,060
The kids aren't prepared unlike King Charles, the other King Charles, not King Charlie Munger,

729
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:34,580
who has been preparing for his job as King of England now for more than 70 years.

730
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:40,260
I sometimes describe the situation like this, picture a football game, at one end of the

731
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:45,880
field is a quarterback, he has great skills, he throws a beautiful pass to the other end

732
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:51,320
the field, and at the other end of the field are the receivers.

733
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,320
They've never been to a practice.

734
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,840
They don't know the rules of the game.

735
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,000
They don't know how to work together as a team.

736
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,920
They're clueless.

737
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,460
So the quarterback is the patriarch and the matriarch.

738
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:09,920
The football is the inheritance or the family business, and the receivers are the kids.

739
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,600
So what are the odds that they're going to catch the football and go score a touchdown?

740
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,000
Probably only around 10%.

741
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,760
I've got the picture on the, the question.

742
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:21,760
Just kidding.

743
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,760
Yeah.

744
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:31,000
The, I probably observed as many just because of my age and to some extent because of things

745
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
like the giving pleasure.

746
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:40,040
I probably observed as many particularly wealthy families the problems and they all are, they

747
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:43,640
get very particular to the family.

748
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:57,280
And in my family, I do not sign a will until my three children have read it, understand

749
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,160
it, and made suggestions.

750
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:05,400
Now my children are in their 60s, and that would not have been a great success.

751
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:10,160
If I'd done the same thing at their 20s, it depends on the family.

752
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,440
It depends on how the kids feel about each other.

753
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,780
There's all kinds of things.

754
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:15,840
It depends on the kind of business you have.

755
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,780
So there's a thousand variables.

756
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:21,200
But I do think that it's,

757
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:26,320
if the children are grown and when the will is read to them,

758
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:30,640
it's the first they've heard about what the deceased

759
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,760
thought about things, the parents have made a terrible

760
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,440
mistake and people,

761
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:42,920
People, well, I've run into all kinds of situations

762
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,560
and some people don't tell their children anything

763
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,800
and some of them try and get them to defend

764
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:51,360
to their will by using their own personal will.

765
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,600
They make a million mistakes

766
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,540
and that's when you don't get to correct.

767
00:59:56,540 --> 01:00:02,100
Certainly in my, well, Charlie's had a lot of experience

768
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:03,440
to it with the law.

769
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,920
- Well, at Berkshire we have a simple problem

770
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:12,920
of estate planning. Just hold the goddamn stock.

771
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:19,920
Well, but that doesn't fit everybody, Charlie. I mean, you know...

772
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,920
No, it only fits 95%.

773
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:31,920
I don't think it necessarily... I don't know, necessarily whether if you have billions of dollars you want to leave it to your children.

774
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,880
That's another question, but if you're ever placed somewhere, I just as soon as Berkshire

775
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:37,880
Stock is.

776
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:38,880
Yeah.

777
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,880
Oh, you're solving the investment problem.

778
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:40,880
Yeah.

779
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,560
But you've got the personal problem of the fact that when there were four, one of the

780
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:49,680
kids pulled the other kid's cat's tail or something like that.

781
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,760
I mean, you're dealing with human beings.

782
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:58,920
And the biggest thing you want is you want your children to get along.

783
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,080
And you want that all through your life.

784
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:06,640
And the estate isn't the only place where you can mess that up, but it's a place where

785
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:13,280
it's a very easy, I mean I know a number of cases where the people did not know what was

786
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:18,080
in the will, whether we're using something involved, and within about 15 minutes each

787
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:23,640
one of them had a lawyer, and they don't get a long sense of it.

788
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,240
It's important to handle it right.

789
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:35,720
And it's important if you want your kids to have a certain value, certain values, it's

790
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,920
important that you live those values.

791
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:43,840
It's important that you talk about it to them.

792
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:50,360
They're learning from you from the day they were born what you're really like.

793
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:58,440
And don't think that a cleverly drawn will substitute for your own behavior in teaching

794
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:02,520
your kids the values you hope that they will have.

795
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:06,080
And then your will should be in conjunction with that.

796
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,400
It should start expressing it.

797
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:17,640
They grow older and then they learn to pass along their values in connection with the

798
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:18,960
size of the state.

799
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,960
If there's family farms, it's one thing.

800
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,080
If there's a bunch of marketable securities, it's something else.

801
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:31,560
But I know in one instance by a particularly rich fellow that once a year, you get those

802
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:37,720
kids together and have a dinner and do all kinds of things to get them to sign their

803
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:42,280
income tax returns in blank because they didn't want them to know how much money they had

804
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,640
and everything.

805
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,800
If that isn't going to work.

806
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,200
I mean, I don't know what necessarily will work with him,

807
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:54,200
but if you want, you know, about Charlie and I've said it,

808
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,160
you know, if you want to figure out

809
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,240
how you want to live your life,

810
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,560
you write your obituary and reverse engineer it.

811
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:04,740
I mean, you know, and Paul Andrews, incidentally,

812
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:07,800
who you mentioned, that TTI lived his great life

813
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,520
as anybody I've known.

814
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:14,520
And he thought about these problems, and he came to me.

815
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:21,380
He was 61, I think, had all the money way beyond what he needed.

816
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,380
He didn't care about it.

817
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:24,500
He liked to give it to people.

818
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,540
He had all kinds of good things he wanted to do.

819
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:31,020
And he said, "For a year, I've been worried about my business, TTI."

820
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:33,380
And he said, "I've got all the money I need.

821
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:35,860
The family's got all the money that I need.

822
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:37,100
But what do I do with the business?"

823
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:40,180
These people have helped me throughout my life.

824
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:42,900
And he says, "I could sell it to a competitor.

825
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:48,300
If I sold it to a competitor, they'd fire my people and keep their people when they

826
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,500
put it together.

827
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:55,060
And if I sell it to a private equity firm or something, they'll be figuring their exit

828
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:58,180
strategy as they sign the papers.

829
01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:02,820
And he said, "So I've been thinking about it a year."

830
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:05,220
And he said, "It isn't a year, such a great guy."

831
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:09,580
He says, "It's just you're the only one left."

832
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:13,260
And we bought it, and we lived happily ever after.

833
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:17,840
And that was a man that knew what life was about.

834
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:22,500
So with that, let's go on to Becky.

835
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:26,300
[APPLAUSE]

836
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:29,540
This question comes from Don Glickstein in Seattle.

837
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:34,460
He says, "Warn his criticized Norfolk Southern's handling of its train derailment, yet has

838
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:38,220
been silent about BNSF's conduct.

839
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:44,840
A federal judge ruled in March that BNSF intentionally and illegally violated an easement agreement

840
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:50,340
on tribal land in Washington state by transporting long trains of crude oil.

841
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:55,220
The same month the judge made his ruling, a BNSF train derailed on tribal land spilling

842
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:58,360
oil in an environmentally sensitive area.

843
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:03,300
What is Warren doing to ensure that BNSF and other Berkshire subsidiaries fulfill their

844
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,300
ethical responsibilities?

845
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,660
He says he's been a Berkshire owner for more than two decades, and he's concerned that

846
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:14,600
Berkshire has no systems to identify and address what he calls reprehensible behavior at BNSF

847
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,100
and other subsidiaries.

848
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:17,100
Greg?

849
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,100
Sure.

850
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:27,300
So the, it is a valid issue that our team obviously has been dealing with at BNSF.

851
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:32,020
We did move crude across that tribal land.

852
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:41,020
We had an agreement that allowed us to move X number of units per day, and we did breach

853
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,020
it.

854
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:43,020
We went over it.

855
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:47,420
There was some fundamental breakdowns there, and our team didn't understand the number

856
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:50,940
of trains that they could move.

857
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:58,620
We have had significant discussions with the tribe looking to resolve the issue, recognizing

858
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:05,340
We obviously benefited from moving those trains, and those type of discussions will continue.

859
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:10,340
I would say there's lessons learned there that we have to, when we make a commitment,

860
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:18,020
understand what that commitment is and live by it, or don't assume we can just move our

861
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:22,300
trains as we wish, or the cargo as we wish, we have to respect those agreements.

862
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:26,580
So there's been a moment learned there, but at the same time, we've taken it very seriously

863
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:30,080
attempted to reach a resolution there.

864
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:36,180
And at some point I hope we do come to a true resolution that's fair both to the tribe and

865
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:38,440
to BNSF.

866
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:44,420
On the derailment side, we did have an issue around the track derailed.

867
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:52,120
We worked very closely with the tribe to mitigate that issue instantly, or at least over a

868
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:55,340
very reasonable period of time.

869
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:56,940
They were very responsive.

870
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:59,140
Our team was very responsive.

871
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:05,940
And there are really no long-term environmental impacts to that spill.

872
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:11,240
And as our teams highlighted in other comments, obviously derailments do occur in the industry.

873
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,020
We take them incredibly serious.

874
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,820
They're not all hazardous, but irrespective of that.

875
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:19,060
We're constantly looking at how do we prevent them?

876
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:24,540
How do we detect them when we potentially have one that's going to occur?

877
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:25,840
and what do we do with our trains?

878
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:29,780
And then ultimately it comes down to responding properly

879
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:31,700
'cause they will occur and I think we have

880
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:34,220
an incredibly dedicated team that's always ready

881
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:37,420
to respond to the communities they're impacting.

882
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:43,340
- There are derailments, how many a year?

883
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:47,220
- Yeah, well there's a thousand plus in the industry.

884
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:53,780
- You start hauling, right, and we're a common carrier.

885
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:56,020
And we take heavy, very heavy freight,

886
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:59,700
and we take them at 100 degrees when it's the weather.

887
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,540
And we take it at zero.

888
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:05,620
And we go around curves, and we have grades.

889
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:12,180
And even a 1% grade, if you're going down a hill,

890
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:14,460
with, I don't know, how much weight by--

891
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:18,140
I mean, a lot of railroading is not an easy business.

892
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:25,300
And of course the systems were designed, you know, in the, in basically in the, in the

893
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:29,020
late 1800s, the mid to late 1800s.

894
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:34,660
And we have 22,000, I think it is miles of track and that doesn't count sightings and

895
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:35,660
some other things.

896
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:37,980
It is not an easy business.

897
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:39,460
We'll make mistakes.

898
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:42,940
Our job, we're not making a mistake because we have a derailment.

899
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:46,740
You're going to, we will have the derailments 10 and 20 years or 30 years from now.

900
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:53,060
I mean that, but we, and we have to carry certain products we wish we didn't have to

901
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:54,060
carry.

902
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:55,780
We're a common carrier.

903
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:59,020
Do we like carrying chlorine and ammonia and all of it?

904
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:04,300
No, but they're going to move from one place to another in this society and we are a common

905
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:11,580
carrier and we load them and if they select our railroad.

906
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:15,700
But we are better than we used to be when we got a long way to go.

907
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:17,020
Was that a fair enough statement?

908
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:17,940
Absolutely.

909
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:19,060
Yeah.

910
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:20,340
OK, station five.

911
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:27,180
Hi, Mr. Warren and Mr. Manga.

912
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:31,340
My name is Su Jinghua from China, Zhongning, Longdao,

913
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:32,300
Kamping.

914
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:35,260
And first of all, I'm so excited and very

915
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:36,780
honored to be here today.

916
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:40,660
And my question is, with more and more people focusing

917
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:45,100
on environmental protection and the government

918
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:47,820
supporting the new energy industry as well.

919
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:52,100
So what are your thoughts on the continued development

920
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,460
of new energy?

921
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:58,020
How may the new energy firm achieve better development

922
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,860
in future?

923
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:02,220
>> Yeah, well, Greg, I think it's the best answer to that

924
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:07,540
because he, since we bought a company called MidAmerican,

925
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:09,700
but now called Berkshire Hathaway Energy,

926
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:14,620
but he's been talking about it yearly, preparing reports,

927
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:17,700
hoping that we can help solve a number of the problems,

928
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:20,260
and we probably spent more money than any utility,

929
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:22,140
I would guess, in the United States.

930
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:22,980
- Absolutely.

931
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:26,740
- And we've just crashed the surface.

932
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:31,060
But it is not easy when you cross state lines.

933
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:35,060
I mean, you've got different jurisdictions,

934
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:39,900
and we should, this country should be ahead of where it is,

935
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,940
in terms of transmission.

936
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:47,980
We have been the biggest factor in helping that.

937
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:50,060
But why don't you tell them a little bit about it?

938
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:51,580
- Sure, thanks, Warren.

939
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:54,900
So there's no question there's an energy transformation

940
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,700
going on around the globe,

941
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:59,620
and as Warren touched on in the US,

942
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:02,380
and in some ways I would hope here in the US,

943
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:07,020
it would be we'd at least have a clear plan

944
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:10,060
across the nation as to how to approach that.

945
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:13,420
But the reality is it is state by state

946
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:14,580
with some exceptions.

947
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:18,340
But so as a result, when you think of Berkshire Hathaway

948
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:24,820
Energy, we own three US utilities there,

949
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:26,980
and they'll participate in multiple states.

950
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:29,980
But they're developing plans state by state,

951
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:34,460
and then trying to integrate them across the various states.

952
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:36,620
The opportunities are significant,

953
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:40,140
because there is a transformation going on.

954
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:45,540
We've outlined our goal on where we're going relative to carbon at BHE,

955
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:53,180
where they'll by 2030 reduce their carbon footprint by 50% relative to 2005.

956
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:58,540
So that's the Paris Accord and the standard they want to hold the utility industry

957
01:11:58,540 --> 01:11:59,980
or the utility companies do.

958
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:03,540
And we're well on that path, but to achieve it is a true journey.

959
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:09,260
I've often talked to warm when we bought Pacific Corp back in the mid-2000s,

960
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:17,620
We immediately recognized to build a lot of renewable energy like we'd been doing in the Midwest in Iowa,

961
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:20,020
but that was basically in a single state.

962
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:22,820
Now Pacific Corp. were in six states.

963
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:25,620
We started that back in the mid-2000s.

964
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:28,920
Here we are, and we laid out a great transmission plan.

965
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,220
Here's how we're going to build it.

966
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:36,320
Here's how we're going to effectuate it and all the benefits for our customers over that period of time.

967
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:43,120
Here we are in 2023 and we have a little more than a third of that at the time it was a $6

968
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:48,240
billion transmission project. Today we have a little more than a third of it built and we've

969
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:54,720
spent probably closer to $7 billion and it's the right outcome. It's still a great outcome for our

970
01:12:54,720 --> 01:13:00,240
customers but that transmission you absolutely as part of the transformation you absolutely have

971
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:04,180
have to build it to remove all that renewable energy.

972
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:06,920
And that's sort of the complexity Warren was highlighting.

973
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:12,120
It is a-- you can't just wake up one day and solve this problem.

974
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:15,660
You start with transmission, and then you build the resources.

975
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:17,780
But at that same company, and if we

976
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:21,040
look at what we're doing across BHE energy

977
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:24,040
and that energy transformation, we

978
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:27,960
have $70 billion of known projects

979
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:32,040
that are really required to properly serve our customers

980
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:35,440
and achieve that type of energy transformation

981
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,200
across those utilities.

982
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,480
And that's in the coming next, in the coming 10 years.

983
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:44,080
So we have a team that's absolutely up to the challenge

984
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,480
or delivering on their commitments.

985
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:49,400
And it's a very good business opportunity

986
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:52,920
for each of our companies and for our shareholders.

987
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:54,400
'Cause as we deploy that capital,

988
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:57,000
we obviously are in a return on equity of it.

989
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
So, but it will be a long journey.

990
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,720
It'll happen over an extended period of time.

991
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,680
And the further you get out there,

992
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:10,240
the more dependent upon the evolution

993
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:13,920
of a variety of technologies that are progressing,

994
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,280
but not there yet.

995
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,000
- You've raised a question.

996
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,400
I wanna just take an extra minute on it

997
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,480
'cause it's so important.

998
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,680
And I don't really know whether our form of government

999
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:32,920
is ideal at all in terms of solving the problem you describe.

1000
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,560
We have solved it one time.

1001
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:39,840
In World War II, we took a country that

1002
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:47,040
was semi-limping along, and we found ourselves in a world war.

1003
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:50,080
And what we did in a world war is we

1004
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:53,960
brought a bunch of people to Washington at a dollar a year.

1005
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:58,100
You know, whether it was Sidney Weinberg or Goldman Sachs, you just name them.

1006
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:08,800
And we gave them enormous power to reorient the resources of the United States to face

1007
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,300
the problem that they faced, which was to create a war machine.

1008
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:17,740
And what they did was they found Henry Keiser, you know, and told him to build ships.

1009
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:22,300
And they went to the Ford Motor Company and said, "You build tanks and some airplanes."

1010
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:30,740
And they reordered the industrial enterprise of the United States in a way that was unbelievable

1011
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:36,700
because they had the power of the federal government and they had the ingenuity of American

1012
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,020
business.

1013
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:46,580
And they had the facilities of American business and it led to a very successful outcome.

1014
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:52,260
But can we do that in a peace time where you've got 50 states and you have to get them to

1015
01:15:52,260 --> 01:16:00,260
to cooperate and you don't have anyone that you can issue orders but you can't designate

1016
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:03,380
where the capital goes at the other end.

1017
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:06,700
We try and do it with tax incentives and all that sort of thing.

1018
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:14,400
But we haven't created the unity of purpose and the machinery that worked in World War

1019
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:20,060
II where essentially everybody felt their one job was to win the war and we figured

1020
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:26,180
about how to use our industrial capacity to, in effect,

1021
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:27,700
defeat the access powers.

1022
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:38,900
And how do you recreate that with the present democratic system?

1023
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:42,540
I'm not sure I know the answer, but I sure know the problem.

1024
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:47,540
And I think that if you can think of a,

1025
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:51,540
if you've got an emergency on your hand,

1026
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:55,500
I mean, you really need to re-engineer the energy system

1027
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:56,780
in the United States.

1028
01:16:56,780 --> 01:17:01,780
I don't think you can do it without something

1029
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:06,600
resembling the machinery, the urgency, whatever.

1030
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,620
The capital's there.

1031
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:09,860
The people are there.

1032
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:21,140
The objective is obvious, and we just don't seem to be able to do it in a peacetime where

1033
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:27,140
we're used to following a given set of procedure.

1034
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:36,300
And China, if you've got one country and we've got 50 states, and we've got a whole

1035
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:42,100
different system of government, we should be up to the test, but so far it hasn't worked.

1036
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:45,420
So thank you for the question.

1037
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:47,740
Becky?

1038
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:51,260
This question comes from Chris Freed in Philadelphia.

1039
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:53,740
He says, we know that Greg Abel and Ajit Jain

1040
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:56,380
are the next generation of Berkshire leaders who

1041
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,340
are currently behind Greg and Ajit

1042
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:01,060
in their perspective roles, respective.

1043
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:11,900
Well, that will be the question that they give their--

1044
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:16,900
Well, Greg will be at some extraordinary circumstance,

1045
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:21,220
but he's going to succeed me.

1046
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:26,220
And then he will be sitting in a position

1047
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:30,220
where he needs his equivalent

1048
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:32,820
or something close to his equivalent,

1049
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:35,440
'cause he's better at many things than I've been.

1050
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:39,060
He will need that substitute.

1051
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:46,260
And when the question comes where, we know Ajit's opinion on that.

1052
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:51,740
And -- but Greg will probably be the one that will make the final decision.

1053
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:54,940
I mean, it's his responsibility.

1054
01:18:54,940 --> 01:19:00,660
And Ajit will give him his best advice, and I think the others are very, very, very high

1055
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:04,060
that Greg would follow it.

1056
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:08,260
But it's not -- those are not easy questions.

1057
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:12,820
It isn't like everybody talks about the executive bench and all of that sort of thing, which

1058
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:13,820
is baloney.

1059
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:24,820
I mean, they don't have that many people that can run five, the largest gap net worth company

1060
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:30,900
and all kinds of diverse businesses, but you don't need five people either.

1061
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:34,820
And you need a lot of good operating managers and you need somebody at the top that allocates

1062
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:38,340
capital and make sure that you've got the right operating manager.

1063
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:46,580
And we've designed something where we separate the insurance and the rest of the business

1064
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:49,220
and I think it's a very good design.

1065
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:52,940
But they would not be smart.

1066
01:19:52,940 --> 01:20:01,620
We wouldn't be smart to name that decision now about the two different areas of the business

1067
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:07,220
because a lot can change between now and then, and the most likely changes, this job changes.

1068
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:09,060
Charlie?

1069
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:17,300
I've got nothing to add. We have a lot of good people that have abritten in the

1070
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:25,620
Berkshire subsidiaries, and there's a reason why our operations have by and large done better than

1071
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:35,820
other big conglomerate companies. And one of them is that we change managers way less

1072
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:42,820
frequently than other people do. And that's helped us.

1073
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:47,820
When Paul Andrews died, we knew who he thought should take over there, but there wasn't any

1074
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:53,540
reason to announce that. I mean, Paul Andrews would have, I wish he'd lived to be honored.

1075
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:57,460
We had one of our managers die not longer going.

1076
01:20:57,460 --> 01:21:00,420
How old was he at the time?

1077
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:02,300
Yeah, mid 90s, Seymour.

1078
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:03,940
Yeah, Seymour, and we're from Seymour.

1079
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:07,700
And Seymour, I wrote him a letter when he was 80

1080
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:11,420
and I said, you know, I'm glad you're 80

1081
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:13,260
and I'll write you again one year 90.

1082
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:15,820
And I wrote him again when he was 90

1083
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:18,140
and he didn't make it to 100.

1084
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:23,140
But he had a terrific follow following.

1085
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:29,660
following him and it really managed to jointly to some extent as the years went by, but it's

1086
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:31,860
case by case.

1087
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:37,060
Main thing to do is have the right person running the whole place.

1088
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:40,500
Okay, station six.

1089
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:44,140
Good morning.

1090
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:45,460
My name's Hatch Okamoto.

1091
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:48,420
I'm from Miyazaki, Japan.

1092
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:49,740
I'm Mr. Buffett.

1093
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:54,160
I was one of the 8,000 employees at Salomon Brothers that you saved.

1094
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:58,180
I was younger back then and was working at Seven War Trade Center.

1095
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:03,980
I've always, always wanted to thank you in person for saving the company, its employees,

1096
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:06,080
including myself and my family.

1097
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,860
So thank you, Mr. Buffett.

1098
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:14,360
Thank you.

1099
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:19,320
And thank Derek, thank Derek Maughan who actually had been over in Japan before that

1100
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:21,920
And who I met for the first time the day before I put him in,

1101
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,480
and he turned out to -- it wouldn't have --

1102
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,240
it wouldn't have worked if Derek hadn't come.

1103
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:29,760
So whatever you taught him in Japan, thank you.

1104
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,200
>> Thank you, sir.

1105
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:36,240
Now my question, time to time you have reminded us

1106
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:39,120
to not bet against America.

1107
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,520
What do you think are the most important things

1108
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:44,240
for U.S. to remain strong?

1109
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:47,080
And on the risk side, if the strength

1110
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:51,080
of the country is undermined. What could be the reasons?

1111
01:22:51,080 --> 01:23:00,960
Well, we've had a lot of tests. I mean, we're such a young country. When you think about

1112
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:05,160
Japan and you think about the United States, it's just incredible how new we are to the

1113
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:15,560
block. I mean, what are we, 234 years old since we started? That's nothing. I mean,

1114
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:19,880
Charlie and I combined, or two-thirds of the, we've lived two-thirds of the life of the country.

1115
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,880
[laughter]

1116
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:27,680
I mean, it really has, I mean, we've been tested at 46 national elections, but, and

1117
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:30,880
we've made some bad choices, and we've had a civil war.

1118
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:38,760
I mean, so the country has had enormous advantages, though, in some way, because we started with

1119
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:45,200
one half of 1% of the world's population in 1790, and we now have something on close

1120
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:52,920
25% of the world's GDP. And it wasn't because we had some incredible advantage in terms

1121
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:59,280
of the land. It was nice to have two oceans on each side back when people tried to rule

1122
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:08,120
the world by ruling the waves. But, you know, we had good neighbors in Canada and Mexico,

1123
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:11,280
But it's a miracle.

1124
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:15,600
And you say, how do we keep the good parts of the system?

1125
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:21,440
While culling out our obvious defects, and we do it in a very herky-jerky manner, but

1126
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:31,240
net, the United States is a better place to live than when I was born by a huge factor.

1127
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:37,800
I mean, I just got a risk now a week ago, and I was just thinking, I don't know who

1128
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:47,360
even Venet Novigate, but I'm for him. But in a million ways, I mean, you can romanticize

1129
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:57,200
about the past, but forget it. It is work, but now we do have an atom bomb, and we wish

1130
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:03,360
nuclear power. We wish the atom had never been split, but it has been, and you can't

1131
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:10,360
put it back in the bottle. So the challenges are huge. Our government always looks, you

1132
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:17,920
know, my dad was in Congress back in the 1940s and it looked like a mess then, you know,

1133
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:22,400
although it was unified by the war to some degree, but it was still very partisan. Now

1134
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:29,400
the problem we have, I think, is that partisanship, it seems to me, has moved toward tribalism.

1135
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:35,880
And tribalism just doesn't work as well.

1136
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:39,460
I mean, when it gets to tribalism, you don't even hear the other side.

1137
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:42,320
And tribalism can lead to mobs.

1138
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,240
I mean, it just, it flows.

1139
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,600
I mean, you've seen it elsewhere.

1140
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,760
We've seen it to a degree here.

1141
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:58,560
So we have to refine in a certain way our democracy as we go along.

1142
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:01,000
We deal with the world we live in.

1143
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:06,280
But if I still had the choice of any place to be born in the world I'd want to be born

1144
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:08,560
in the United States and I'd want to be born today.

1145
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:14,800
I mean, it is a better world than we've ever had.

1146
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:21,480
And with present day communications we can also see much more how terrible it is in many

1147
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:22,960
ways.

1148
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,480
And it's got problems.

1149
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:30,760
When I was born in 1930 there were two billion people in the world.

1150
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:35,480
And now there's maybe 7.7 billion and growing.

1151
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:40,400
And we went millennia with really no change in population.

1152
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:49,280
So we, and of course we've introduced energy into, in an incredible way, into something

1153
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:56,960
where we now have 7.7 billion people using way more energy than they did when I was born

1154
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:58,280
when there were 2 billion people.

1155
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:03,120
So it's an exciting world.

1156
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,240
It's a challenging world.

1157
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:07,880
And I don't know the solutions on things.

1158
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,720
I do think that we do need to think

1159
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:12,200
about different solutions in terms of how

1160
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:16,120
we get important problems solved and that we don't

1161
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:20,480
kid ourselves that something magic will happen

1162
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,920
or that everybody will get together and will all just

1163
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:32,160
here and then go away by 2050 or anything. And how well we adapt to that. We will see.

1164
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:39,360
I would say so far it doesn't look very promising, but then I'm sure that when Lincoln looked

1165
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:44,040
at it, what was going on in the Civil War didn't look very promising either. So I think

1166
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:50,440
that the U.S. is capable of doing remarkable things and I think it wouldn't surprise me

1167
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:51,440
if they do it again.

1168
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,920
Charlie, me, are you?

1169
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:54,680
Pardon?

1170
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:59,440
Well, I'm slightly less optimistic than Warren is.

1171
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:04,000
I think the best road to end to human happiness

1172
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,200
is to expect less.

1173
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:09,520
I think it's going to get tougher.

1174
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:14,280
And I think the solution of having a huge proportion

1175
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:18,720
of the young and brilliant people all go into wealth management

1176
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:23,600
is a crazy development in terms of its natural consequences

1177
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,680
for American civilization.

1178
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:30,320
We don't need as many wealth managers as we have.

1179
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,080
You wouldn't.

1180
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:34,920
Charlie was born on January 1st, 1924.

1181
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:38,800
And you'd hate to go back to that, wouldn't you, Charlie?

1182
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:39,600
Yes, I would.

1183
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:44,000
And I like more wealth managers who are just merely

1184
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,200
to the fact there's more wealth.

1185
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:50,120
But we've got, I don't like everybody going

1186
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:53,760
into wealth management, right, MIT or something.

1187
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,080
I think the world's a little crazy now.

1188
01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:00,600
- Take your choice.

1189
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:01,800
Okay, Becky.

1190
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:08,120
- This question comes from Dennis DeGenerro.

1191
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:12,240
As Warren stated in the 2022 annual report,

1192
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:16,720
Berkshire will always hold a boatload of cash in U.S. Treasury bills. It will also

1193
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:22,180
avoid behavior that could result in any uncomfortable cash needs at inconvenient times, including

1194
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:27,620
financial panics and unprecedented insurance losses.

1195
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:31,480
After Warren passes away, his A-shares will be converted into B-shares and distributed

1196
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:37,080
to various foundations. These foundations will then sell the shares to fund their causes.

1197
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:42,220
Warren estimates it will take 12 to 15 years for all his shares to be sold. I worry that

1198
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:44,900
that a corporate raider like Cairo Icon or a group

1199
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:46,300
will buy up enough of these shares

1200
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:47,500
to take control of Berkshire

1201
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,700
and completely disregard Warren's philosophy

1202
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:52,380
of holding a lot of cash in US Treasury bills

1203
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:55,700
and instead be greedy, reckless, and highly speculative

1204
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:57,020
and ruin Berkshire's position

1205
01:29:57,020 --> 01:29:59,360
as a rock solid financial fortress.

1206
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,740
I also worry that changes might be made

1207
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:03,980
in how Berkshire subsidiaries are run.

1208
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:07,580
Do Warren and Charlie worry that these things could happen?

1209
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:11,420
- Well, I think it's fair to say we think about it plenty,

1210
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:14,420
But I don't worry enormously.

1211
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:22,660
If we-- and it's true that Greg and the directors will

1212
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:24,660
have a honeymoon period for a long time,

1213
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:28,900
because simply because of the bolts, it will still remain.

1214
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:33,620
I mean, and-- but it's true that eventually they

1215
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:38,060
will get judged based on how well our operation

1216
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:39,180
fairs versus others.

1217
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:45,520
And now if we don't pay any dividends in 12 or 15 years, you're talking a trillion and

1218
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,900
a half that it would take to take over.

1219
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:53,700
And I think if we can't, that limits the group.

1220
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:56,260
They like to think about how much they can borrow against it.

1221
01:30:56,260 --> 01:30:59,620
It doesn't work, won't you?

1222
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:05,540
And some of these, there's nobody that can come close to doing it themselves.

1223
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:14,300
I think that the important thing is that Bershaw be regarded as a national asset rather than

1224
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:15,860
a national liability.

1225
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:19,540
We've got to be a plus to the country with our form of operation.

1226
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:27,660
We certainly have got a record which will then be 12 or 15 years longer done with much

1227
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:30,400
more capital, more companies.

1228
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:37,700
things will have happened where our hundreds of billions can work its way into the economy

1229
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:44,000
in terms of lots of jobs, lots of products, lots of behavior, and it can be compared with

1230
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,720
other things. So I think we went out, if we deserve to

1231
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:55,720
went out and I think the odds of that happening are very, very, very high.

1232
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:56,720
Charlie?

1233
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:05,720
Well, we -- I don't spend much time worrying about something that could happen 50 years

1234
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:08,720
ago and after I'm dead.

1235
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:15,040
I think if you sort of take care of each day's responsibilities pretty well and think ahead

1236
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:20,880
as well as you can, and you just take the results as they fall.

1237
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:28,560
So I'm Phil Salahill, but I'm not -- I need you spreading unnecessarily.

1238
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,680
>> Okay.

1239
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:35,440
Neither one of us are worried, basically.

1240
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:37,720
But we -- but we plan.

1241
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:38,720
We do plan.

1242
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:43,360
And, you know, I've got a model in my mind of what Berkshire has been.

1243
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:47,780
that model's been modified plenty of times over 58 years.

1244
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:50,760
The one thing I knew initially, or very quickly,

1245
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:52,360
was it shouldn't be a textile company.

1246
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:55,000
That was an important decision.

1247
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:00,120
And we've just played the hand as it's come along.

1248
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:03,080
And we've made a few really good decisions,

1249
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:05,520
and we'll never make a decision that kills us.

1250
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:09,080
The only things that are a threat to the planet,

1251
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:12,220
we don't have any answer for those.

1252
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:16,900
But we do, we keep ourselves in better shape

1253
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:18,660
than anybody else.

1254
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:22,820
And we just aren't going to have big

1255
01:33:22,820 --> 01:33:25,360
maturities of debt that come along.

1256
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:28,900
We aren't going to have insurance policies

1257
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:31,180
that can be cashed in en masse.

1258
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:33,580
And we will sit with a lot, what looks like

1259
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:34,860
a huge amount of capital.

1260
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:36,540
And it is a huge amount of capital,

1261
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:38,020
but there's a huge amount of earning power.

1262
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:40,540
There's a huge amount of diversity, everything.

1263
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:44,880
So our business model will be graded,

1264
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:48,340
and it'll be graded against a lot of people

1265
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:50,620
that we'd like to be graded against.

1266
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:55,460
So I think we're handling something very secure

1267
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:57,340
over to the future, and I think we've got

1268
01:33:57,340 --> 01:33:59,880
the shareholder base like nobody has.

1269
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:01,860
I mean, there isn't anybody in the country

1270
01:34:01,860 --> 01:34:05,020
that I know of unless they've had a shareholder

1271
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:07,380
employee-owned company prior to going public

1272
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:08,740
or something of the sort.

1273
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:21,300
But this is the product of 58 years of regarding the shareholder as the owner of the company.

1274
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:22,300
But what does that mean?

1275
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:24,380
That means having happy customers.

1276
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:32,420
It means being welcomed by your community rather than having them turn you away.

1277
01:34:32,420 --> 01:34:37,900
It means that the government feels better with you if there's a financial crisis because

1278
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:45,300
year, you can provide something that actually the country can't under some circumstances,

1279
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:47,820
and you'll be there.

1280
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:51,140
And same time, it'll be good for the business.

1281
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:57,820
And we will have crises of one sort or another, but if they aren't challenging the planet,

1282
01:34:57,820 --> 01:35:04,740
which worries you in terms of some of the threats that we have, we'll be a plus to the

1283
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:11,740
United States and if we're opposed to the United States we'll survive.

1284
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:15,060
Okay.

1285
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:19,940
Station 7.

1286
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:25,540
Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger, thank you for having us this weekend.

1287
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:31,060
My name is Beau Clayton and I'm from Durham, North Carolina.

1288
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:38,060
One of the reasons that we are all here is that you're great storytellers, and we carry

1289
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:41,840
those stories back home with us.

1290
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:51,620
Can you please share a couple stories that maybe we haven't heard before about Mr. Abel

1291
01:35:51,620 --> 01:36:00,300
and Mr. Jane that captured their character and their caliber as leaders.

1292
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:07,940
[ Applause ]

1293
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:14,140
>> I'll start out with the G. He walked into the office in 1986,

1294
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:16,840
and I had gotten the bright idea of going

1295
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:19,700
into the reinsurance business, I think it may be 1969.

1296
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:24,460
So I'd stumbled along for 17 years,

1297
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:29,180
and I had a wonderful guy that ran it.

1298
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:35,700
But he also liked certain brokers.

1299
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:38,900
And I mean, he was running it the traditional way,

1300
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:43,420
the top quality and everything else.

1301
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:49,500
But he didn't try and change the system.

1302
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:54,500
He tried to improve the system to some degree.

1303
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:58,020
And we just went nowhere.

1304
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:00,940
17 years wandering around in the wilderness,

1305
01:37:00,940 --> 01:37:05,060
and I thought I knew we could have something good.

1306
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:07,900
And then Ajit came in on a Saturday.

1307
01:37:07,900 --> 01:37:12,900
And Mike Goldberg and Steerdiam, I think.

1308
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:17,140
And Mike deserves to be enshrined

1309
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:19,700
and perpetuity for that act.

1310
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:22,820
And I talked with him a while.

1311
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:25,060
I think maybe I was opening the mail on Saturday

1312
01:37:25,060 --> 01:37:26,780
while I talked with him.

1313
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:31,780
And he had absolutely zero experience with insurance,

1314
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:35,900
but he'd actually seen a good bit

1315
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:39,140
of how corporate America operated

1316
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:42,500
because he'd been in management consulting.

1317
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:44,820
And after talking with him,

1318
01:37:44,820 --> 01:37:56,180
I knew I'd struck gold and so I hired him and gave him the backing of some money.

1319
01:37:56,180 --> 01:38:05,620
And we had a very good period in the market, almost right away for him to act and to cheat.

1320
01:38:05,620 --> 01:38:14,780
You know, if I had the top pick of 10 insurance managers in the world, I could take all 10.

1321
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:18,860
And they wouldn't, you can't replace Ajit.

1322
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:23,260
And we still enjoy talking.

1323
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:28,540
We don't talk as frequently as we used to, but we used to talk about it every day.

1324
01:38:28,540 --> 01:38:32,940
But he is one of a kind.

1325
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:38,660
And you know, if they're going to stick around long enough, you only need one of a kind.

1326
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:43,940
Paul Andrews stuck around at TTI, had all the money in the world.

1327
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:48,140
Every time I talk to him about getting a raise or something of the sort, he said, "We'll

1328
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:51,140
talk about that next year."

1329
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:56,580
He was not what you get when you get the top draft picks from the leading business schools.

1330
01:38:56,580 --> 01:39:05,020
I will say this, I have never looked at where anybody went to school in terms of hiring.

1331
01:39:05,020 --> 01:39:06,580
Somebody mailed me a resume or something.

1332
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:11,500
I don't get where they went to school.

1333
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:16,820
It just so happens that Achille went to some pretty good schools, but he isn't Achille

1334
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:18,500
because he went to the schools.

1335
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:23,340
And, uh, Charlie didn't tell a story or two.

1336
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:25,500
How'd you find Louis Bencenny?

1337
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:27,980
Well, he was there.

1338
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:31,620
But you got to recognize him.

1339
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:38,300
I asked Louis once how he managed to play first-string football at, I think, Stanford,

1340
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:42,820
the only way to hundred and fifty-five pounds. And he said, "Well," he said, "I was pretty

1341
01:39:42,820 --> 01:39:51,420
quick." And he was pretty quick, but we have found a lot of people within our companies

1342
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:54,220
who were pretty quick. It's a...

1343
01:39:54,220 --> 01:39:59,420
Yeah, we had one guy that quit at fourth grade in Ben Rosner. Am I wrong?

1344
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:06,500
Oh, yeah. Totally self-educated. Ben Rosner knew more about retailing and difficult neighborhoods

1345
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:15,500
and anybody and he watched everything in his business like a hawk and he was amazing.

1346
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:21,220
Now there was an example, we never found anybody who could do what, when Ben died,

1347
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:23,220
that ability left us.

1348
01:40:23,220 --> 01:40:29,580
>> Yeah, and you want a story, it's kind of interesting because Ben Rosner had a partner,

1349
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:40,060
Leo Simon. And at least Leo Simon was Moana Burke's son-in-law and Leo, therefore, was

1350
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:50,020
very, very, very wealthy and then started with nothing, but they liked each other. And

1351
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:59,740
One time, well before they got involved in the business we bought,

1352
01:40:59,740 --> 01:41:07,700
but they got the idea of buying a submarine from World War I

1353
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:09,900
and taking it to the Century of Progress,

1354
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:15,020
which was the world's far end effect in Chicago, I think, in 1933.

1355
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:17,900
So they bought the submarine for probably nothing.

1356
01:41:17,900 --> 01:41:21,000
And they figured, you know, the average guy from Omaha

1357
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,040
was going to his first world's fair,

1358
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:25,480
get into a submarine for a quarter or something,

1359
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:26,480
that they'd pay it.

1360
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:30,920
So they hauled it from Florida, wherever they got.

1361
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:32,640
They hauled it to Chicago,

1362
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:35,120
and then they got into Chicago.

1363
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:38,440
And they were hauling a submarine down the streets

1364
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:43,160
of Chicago, and it was creating traffic problems,

1365
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:45,480
like nobody could imagine.

1366
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:50,480
So a cop came over and he said to Ben,

1367
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:53,080
he says, "Where do you think you guys

1368
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:55,680
"are going with a submarine?"

1369
01:41:55,680 --> 01:42:00,480
Ben says, "Well, you'll have to talk to my partner,

1370
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:01,820
"Mr. Cawone."

1371
01:42:01,820 --> 01:42:03,160
(laughing)

1372
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:06,040
The cop says, "You're on, just keep going."

1373
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:08,480
And that was Ben Rosner.

1374
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:10,240
And then Leo Simon died.

1375
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:14,680
And when he died in 1967 or so,

1376
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:24,320
Ben Rosner kept the ring half the profits to his widow, who was incredibly rich, of

1377
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:27,760
course, being Moe Annenberg's first-born daughter.

1378
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:35,600
I think Moe had nine girls in a row before Walter came along, the tenth, I may be lost

1379
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:36,600
by one.

1380
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:47,920
I went to this fancy apartment and anyway, Ben kept her in for half the deal and he

1381
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:52,340
had her sign the rent checks just so she would look like she was doing something in this

1382
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:53,900
business.

1383
01:42:53,900 --> 01:42:58,000
And she didn't need the money obviously, but he just felt he was obligated once his partner

1384
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,620
and Leo died.

1385
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:02,180
And then she started criticizing him.

1386
01:43:02,180 --> 01:43:07,180
And at that point, Ben went to her, his lawyer,

1387
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:11,300
or his lawyer, actually, Will Feldsteiner,

1388
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:12,460
when whatever happened to Will,

1389
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:16,780
but he gave me a call because Ben wanted to call me

1390
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:19,140
because he wanted me to buy it.

1391
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:22,580
And he wanted me, if I bought it,

1392
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:26,780
he'd be rid of the ex-partner's wife.

1393
01:43:26,780 --> 01:43:31,780
And he'd get, he had me and Charlie come back

1394
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:35,620
and we went to Will Feldsteiners office

1395
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:37,640
and Beds says I'll work 'til the end of the year

1396
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:38,740
and that's all.

1397
01:43:38,740 --> 01:43:40,780
But I'll show you this thing for six million bucks

1398
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:42,820
and I had two million to cash and a couple million

1399
01:43:42,820 --> 01:43:45,140
to real estate and a couple million to operating earnings.

1400
01:43:45,140 --> 01:43:46,860
That was just crazy.

1401
01:43:46,860 --> 01:43:50,740
But he felt if he was getting a lousy price,

1402
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:55,740
she was taking a half of, a lousy price for half the money.

1403
01:43:55,860 --> 01:44:00,860
So he looked at me at some point.

1404
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:04,140
Charlie, you describe the rest of it.

1405
01:44:04,140 --> 01:44:05,300
Look at it again.

1406
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:08,260
- He said, "I heard here the fastest draw in the west."

1407
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:09,620
He says, "Draw."

1408
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:11,620
(laughing)

1409
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:13,300
- We're in the New York Lawyer's office.

1410
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:14,140
- Yeah.

1411
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:17,780
- And this guy is selling his baby

1412
01:44:17,780 --> 01:44:19,420
and he told us he was leaving.

1413
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:20,740
I got Charlie on the side.

1414
01:44:20,740 --> 01:44:23,820
I said, "If this guy leaves at the end of the year,

1415
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:25,460
"you can throw away every psychology book

1416
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:30,740
has ever been written. I mean, it isn't going to happen. And so we bought it and we lived

1417
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:37,060
happily ever after with Ben. And one time he was taking me over to see a property we had

1418
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:48,740
in Brooklyn. And along the way I said, "Ben, I promised you I wouldn't interfere in the

1419
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:54,460
business when we started." And he knew a butt was coming and he just said, "Thank you,

1420
01:44:54,460 --> 01:44:56,460
And they shut me up.

1421
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:57,460
[laughter]

1422
01:44:57,460 --> 01:44:58,460
He was a lot of fun.

1423
01:44:58,460 --> 01:45:02,460
We have so many Ben Rosner stories, but now you've heard one that hasn't been published

1424
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:03,460
before.

1425
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:05,460
Okay, Becky.

1426
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:09,460
>> This question comes from Chai Gohill.

1427
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:12,460
He writes, "This is for a cheap.

1428
01:45:12,460 --> 01:45:16,460
Re-insurance industry is going through one of the hardest pricing environments in the

1429
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:18,460
last 15 years.

1430
01:45:18,460 --> 01:45:22,460
Berkshire historically has participated during these stress times when economic returns are

1431
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:23,460
very attractive.

1432
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:28,020
This year it appears Berkshire has not been interested in deploying its resources towards

1433
01:45:28,020 --> 01:45:31,660
property/cat reinsurance despite such strong returns.

1434
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:36,980
Can you elaborate on reasons for not participating despite these returns and your broader view

1435
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:42,500
on how you're planning to shape your reinsurance business post-acquisition of Allegheny?

1436
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:43,700
Okay.

1437
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:49,100
In terms of Allegheny, that's an easy response.

1438
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:53,940
We treat operating units independent of each other.

1439
01:45:53,940 --> 01:45:57,300
And as far as Allegheny is concerned, they have a major presence in the re-insurance

1440
01:45:57,300 --> 01:46:01,340
business under the brand name of Transatlantic Reef.

1441
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:04,620
That company will operate the way it's been operating in the past.

1442
01:46:04,620 --> 01:46:08,100
There will be no change in terms of strategy or management.

1443
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:11,060
And they will keep doing what they're doing.

1444
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:16,180
They'll be very successful and hopefully they'll keep being successful.

1445
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:21,860
Now, in terms of the property cat business that I have been active in over these last

1446
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:27,660
several years, you are right that the last 15 years has been a difficult time, prices

1447
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:29,460
have not been attractive.

1448
01:46:29,460 --> 01:46:34,700
And even though we have had some presence in the property cat business in the last 15

1449
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:39,420
years, it really is being minimal.

1450
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:45,420
This December 31st, which is a big renewal date for cat re-insurance, we were hoping

1451
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:51,940
that we would get a few days in the sun and we'd be able to deploy our capital and be

1452
01:46:51,940 --> 01:46:55,660
able to write some fairly attractive business.

1453
01:46:55,660 --> 01:47:02,100
As it happened towards the end of December, till about the third week of December, I was

1454
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:09,380
very optimistic that we would get a chance to put several billion dollars on the books.

1455
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:15,340
But in the last 10 days of December, unfortunately a lot of capacity came out of the woodworks

1456
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:20,660
pricing that we were expecting to realize didn't really come and meet our

1457
01:47:20,660 --> 01:47:24,540
pricing requirements as a result of which January 1 was a big disappointment.

1458
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:29,020
We did not write as much as we were hoping to write. Now fast forward to

1459
01:47:29,020 --> 01:47:35,900
April 1 which is another big renewal date. We had a lot of powder dry and we

1460
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:40,460
were lucky that we kept the powder dry because April 1 suddenly prices zoomed

1461
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:44,260
up again a lot higher than what they were on January 1 and started to look

1462
01:47:44,260 --> 01:47:52,180
attractive to us. So now we have a portfolio that is very heavily exposed to

1463
01:47:52,180 --> 01:47:58,740
property catastrophe. To put that in perspective, our exposure today is almost

1464
01:47:58,740 --> 01:48:06,860
50% more than what it was five, six months ago. So you know, we I think we

1465
01:48:06,860 --> 01:48:12,580
have written as much as our capacity will allow us to write. We are very happy

1466
01:48:12,580 --> 01:48:16,420
happy with what we've written, the margins have been healthy.

1467
01:48:16,420 --> 01:48:23,100
The only thing that I want to mention to you is that while the margins have been healthy,

1468
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:27,220
we have a very unbalanced portfolio.

1469
01:48:27,220 --> 01:48:33,780
What that means is if there's a big hurricane in Florida, we will have a very substantial

1470
01:48:33,780 --> 01:48:40,020
loss as opposed to that if we have a very big loss anywhere other than Florida.

1471
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:43,820
to our competition, we will have a much smaller loss.

1472
01:48:43,820 --> 01:48:47,020
Net-net, I'm very happy with the portfolio.

1473
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:48,340
It's been a lot better.

1474
01:48:48,340 --> 01:48:51,380
It is a lot better than what it's been in the past.

1475
01:48:51,380 --> 01:48:52,820
I don't know how long it will last.

1476
01:48:52,820 --> 01:48:58,860
And of course, if the hurricane happens in Florida,

1477
01:48:58,860 --> 01:49:03,260
we could lose-- across all the units,

1478
01:49:03,260 --> 01:49:06,180
we could lose as much as $15 billion.

1479
01:49:06,180 --> 01:49:09,100
And if there isn't a loss, we'll make several billion dollars

1480
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:10,100
his profit.

1481
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:17,900
And G, tell him how long, when you call me and said you'd like to expose us to whatever

1482
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:23,860
was a couple billion more of exposure, how long I took to say yes.

1483
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:25,100
Yeah.

1484
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:31,060
So the way we think about our exposures, you know, in the property, in the insurance operations

1485
01:49:31,060 --> 01:49:37,300
collectively across the entire company, given that we have about a little less than 300

1486
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:44,460
billion of capital, we think of that as a 55% exposure that you're willing to take on.

1487
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:50,940
So to complete Warren's story, a few weeks ago we had about $13 billion of exposure all

1488
01:49:50,940 --> 01:49:53,820
across the globe.

1489
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:58,300
And I called up Warren, I said, "We have to 13, it'll be nice if we can go up to 15,

1490
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:00,620
that's a good round number."

1491
01:50:00,620 --> 01:50:05,100
And that was less than a 30 second phone call.

1492
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:09,980
I think Warren said yes without even listening to what the numbers were.

1493
01:50:09,980 --> 01:50:14,220
I hope he calls me again.

1494
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:19,340
Okay, station eight.

1495
01:50:19,340 --> 01:50:20,660
Hello.

1496
01:50:20,660 --> 01:50:27,460
My name is Adal Flores and I've been a shitholder for about 16 years and I'm coming from Guadalajara,

1497
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:29,780
Mexico.

1498
01:50:29,780 --> 01:50:33,740
My question is for Warren and Charlie.

1499
01:50:33,740 --> 01:50:39,140
Companies have the eternal dilemma between building products that can make profits and

1500
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:42,120
increase their company competitive position.

1501
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:46,320
In the best case, you can build products that have both characteristics at the same time

1502
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:47,820
like Google did.

1503
01:50:47,820 --> 01:50:53,580
But most of the time, companies need to choose between short-term profits and long-term defensibility.

1504
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:59,240
For example, Amazon was focused on building their famous Amazon flywheel with limited

1505
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:05,600
profit it initially in order to obtain stronger network effects with the hope of getting more

1506
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:08,040
defensible profits in the future.

1507
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:13,300
When you invest, you constantly speak about the importance of building competitive modes.

1508
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:18,280
What advice would you give to CEOs about how to balance this dilemma, which is essentially

1509
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:21,600
short-term profit versus long-term defintibility?

1510
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:22,600
Thank you.

1511
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:28,160
Well, the answer is to control your destiny, which we've been able to do at Berkshire.

1512
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:37,300
So we feel no pressure from Wall Street.

1513
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:38,720
We don't have investor calls.

1514
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:41,180
We don't have to make promises.

1515
01:51:41,180 --> 01:51:48,000
We get a chance to make our own mistakes and occasionally find something that works well.

1516
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:55,000
But we recognize that the people in this room and people like them are the ones we're working

1517
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:01,760
for and we're not working for a bunch of people that care about whether we meet the

1518
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:11,960
court or estimate or anything so that we have a freedom that we get to use and we're interested

1519
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:16,360
in owning a wonderful business forever.

1520
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:23,360
Well, there aren't very many wonderful businesses, but we do learn a lot as we go along.

1521
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:29,560
Charlie and I have often mentioned how we learned so much when we bought C's candy,

1522
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:30,560
which we did.

1523
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:36,560
But we learned when we bought Ben Roser's chain of women's dress shops, spread all over

1524
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:40,760
the eastern part of the country.

1525
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:48,040
We learned when we tried getting into the department store business back in 1966.

1526
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:53,560
As the ink was drying on our purchase price, we realized we'd done something dumb.

1527
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:57,160
We're learning all the time how consumers behave.

1528
01:52:57,160 --> 01:53:05,240
I'm not going to be able to learn the technical aspects of businesses, but that'd be nice

1529
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:06,560
if I knew it.

1530
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:08,760
But it isn't essential.

1531
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:20,040
And you know, we are obviously, we've got a business at Apple which is larger than our

1532
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:28,640
energy business and we may only own 5.6 or 7%, but our ownership goes up every year and

1533
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:36,020
I don't understand the phone at all, but I do understand consumer behavior and I know

1534
01:53:36,020 --> 01:53:39,920
I know how people think about whether to buy a second car.

1535
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:42,920
I know how they go out to different,

1536
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:47,700
we own auto dealerships, we're earning all the time

1537
01:53:47,700 --> 01:53:51,060
from all of our businesses, how people react to granite

1538
01:53:51,060 --> 01:53:54,400
versus selling them something else.

1539
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:58,240
And so C's was a sort of breakthrough,

1540
01:53:58,240 --> 01:54:01,920
but we just keep learning as to more about

1541
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:10,400
how people behave and how a good business can turn into a bad business and how some

1542
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:19,640
good businesses can maintain their competitive advantage over time.

1543
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:30,240
So we don't have some formula.

1544
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:34,800
But we can also tell in 10 seconds whether it's something of interest.

1545
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:41,400
I mean, when I get these calls and we want to send decks and all that sort of thing,

1546
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:42,400
which is nonsense.

1547
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:50,520
I mean, it's a bunch of guys sitting and get paid for growing up these projections of the

1548
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:51,520
future and everything like that.

1549
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:56,000
If they knew the future, we don't know the future, but we do know certain kinds of businesses.

1550
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:01,280
We know what the right price is and we know what we think we can project out in terms

1551
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:09,800
of consumer behavior and consumer threats to a business.

1552
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:12,680
That's what we've been about and that's what we'll continue to be about.

1553
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:16,720
We do get, we don't get smarter over time.

1554
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:23,360
We get a little wiser though, following it over time and you can do it while sitting

1555
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:26,600
in the office with a telephone too, which we like. Charlie?

1556
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:29,280
- Well, tell them the story of the Japanese investment.

1557
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:31,600
That should be told again.

1558
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:34,760
That's a nice story.

1559
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:37,400
- Well, it was pretty simple.

1560
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:43,360
Back when I started, other people were going through Playboy

1561
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:46,320
and I was going through Moody's basically.

1562
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:51,160
There's a movie out called Turn Every Page,

1563
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:55,320
which I saw again for the second time a couple of days ago,

1564
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:58,440
Lizzie Gottlieb, and I recommend everybody in this world

1565
01:55:58,440 --> 01:56:01,760
watch that because I turned every page in the past.

1566
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:06,120
And I did it for thousands and thousands of pages in Moody's

1567
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:08,440
and I did it at the Department of Public Utilities

1568
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:12,720
and in Boston, I did it at the Insurance Department.

1569
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:14,160
You just kept turning pages.

1570
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:19,080
Well, that goes on for a while.

1571
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:24,080
But now we need big ideas in order to find things.

1572
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:26,920
And what was your question, Charlie?

1573
01:56:26,920 --> 01:56:28,720
- Did you tell them about the Japanese?

1574
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:30,760
- Well, the Japanese thing was simple.

1575
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:34,000
I mean, I like looking at companies.

1576
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:37,120
I mean, I like looking at figures about companies.

1577
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:42,120
And here were five very, very substantial companies,

1578
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:44,880
understandable companies.

1579
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:47,960
Most of them, maybe all of them,

1580
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:50,720
we'd done business with in a dozen different ways.

1581
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:53,400
If you go a couple miles from where this place is,

1582
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:57,960
our last coal generating plant was built

1583
01:56:57,960 --> 01:56:59,800
by one of the companies.

1584
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:06,240
So here they were, they were sitting as a group

1585
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:10,920
where they were earning, we'll say 14%

1586
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:15,120
on what we were gonna pay to buy them.

1587
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:16,680
They were paying decent dividends,

1588
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:19,800
they were going to repurchase shares in some cases.

1589
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:21,280
They owned a whole bunch of businesses

1590
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:23,200
that we could understand as a group,

1591
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:25,760
although we didn't mean we had deep understanding

1592
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:27,680
on anything, but we seen them operating everything.

1593
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:29,160
There wasn't anything to it.

1594
01:57:29,160 --> 01:57:34,540
And at the same time, we could take out the currency risk

1595
01:57:34,540 --> 01:57:38,020
by financing in the end,

1596
01:57:38,020 --> 01:57:40,480
and that was going to cost us a half of 1%.

1597
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:42,120
Well, if you get 14% on one side,

1598
01:57:42,120 --> 01:57:44,200
a half a percent on the other side,

1599
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:48,360
And you've got money that, you know, forever,

1600
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:52,680
and they're doing intelligent things and they're sizable.

1601
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:55,040
So we just started buying them.

1602
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:58,520
I didn't even probably tell Greg until maybe six months

1603
01:57:58,520 --> 01:58:00,480
after we'd gotten going.

1604
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:05,480
And then when we hit 5%, in all of them,

1605
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:10,120
we announced on my birthday at 90th,

1606
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:12,400
that we owned over 5%.

1607
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:16,360
and recently went over for the first time

1608
01:58:16,360 --> 01:58:20,440
to visit with them and we were more than pleasantly surprised,

1609
01:58:20,440 --> 01:58:23,160
delighted with what we find there.

1610
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:25,900
And now we own 7.4% of it.

1611
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:29,140
We won't go over 9.9% without their agreeing

1612
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:33,220
and we sold another 164, whatever it is.

1613
01:58:33,220 --> 01:58:39,440
Billion of a, again.

1614
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:42,360
- What have done for us if we only had five billion

1615
01:58:42,360 --> 01:58:48,080
dollars or something and it made ten billion dollars simply in that way.

1616
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:49,080
Yeah.

1617
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:50,680
We would look like heroes.

1618
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:56,520
Now ten billion just sort of disappears as a little dot in Bertrand's reports.

1619
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:57,520
But it's fun.

1620
01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:00,760
And it is fun and it is ten billion dollars.

1621
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:04,640
And Charlie says it keeps me out of bars.

1622
01:59:04,640 --> 01:59:07,520
I probably talked to him about it.

1623
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:10,760
I probably talked to Charlie about this the year after I started.

1624
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:17,760
But who knows? I mean, I knew he'd like it. I mean, obviously. And we tried to do every

1625
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:20,760
dollar we could do. We could only do about ten billion.

1626
01:59:20,760 --> 01:59:27,540
Yeah. Well, not even that, quite that much. But, you know, we are four or five billion

1627
01:59:27,540 --> 01:59:34,400
ahead plus dividends, and we got to carry this terrific. And, you know, and they welcome

1628
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:39,600
us, and they should welcome us. But we love it the way they're operating. We're not there

1629
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:43,640
to tell them what to do in the least.

1630
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:50,120
So we did, but we did say we'd never go over 9.9 and we made it.

1631
01:59:50,120 --> 01:59:53,320
They know that we'll be true to our word.

1632
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:59,040
I went over there partly to introduce Greg to those people because we're going to be

1633
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:02,080
with them 10, 20, 30, 40 years from now.

1634
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:06,440
And they may occasionally find something that we can do jointly.

1635
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:08,680
And they look forward to doing that.

1636
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:10,840
And we look forward to it.

1637
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:15,200
And in addition, we have some other operating businesses in Japan.

1638
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:18,680
So, Greg, do you have anything?

1639
02:00:18,680 --> 02:00:25,640
The only thing I would add is that one, as Warren you went over there, it was to build

1640
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:29,760
the trust with these Japanese companies because we do hope there's long-term opportunities.

1641
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:34,720
But fundamentally, as you highlighted, they're an incredible -- they've been a very good

1642
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:35,720
investment.

1643
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:38,760
I'd also highlight the five meetings we had.

1644
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:40,160
We're really quite remarkable.

1645
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:42,520
I mean, these companies, the culture and the history

1646
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:44,800
around it and how proud they are, you know,

1647
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,520
there's just moments of learning from them.

1648
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:50,320
So it was just a great experience to spend really two days

1649
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:52,440
with the five companies.

1650
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:56,720
>> And an issue that we intended to be 56 billion of yen

1651
02:00:56,720 --> 02:01:00,800
that we were issuing and selling turned out to be 164.4,

1652
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:02,840
something like that.

1653
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:06,680
Everything works so well, and as Charlie says it,

1654
02:01:06,680 --> 02:01:11,680
it doesn't move 500 billion of net worth that much.

1655
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:17,480
But this one, it will keep adding over the years

1656
02:01:17,480 --> 02:01:21,680
to Berkshire's value with this very wide spread,

1657
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:24,680
probably four or 500 million dollars a year.

1658
02:01:24,680 --> 02:01:29,680
And we'll just keep looking for more opportunities.

1659
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:40,200
And Japan, we have, Berger is the largest borrower outside

1660
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:44,920
of corporate borrower, outside of Japan that exists.

1661
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:48,280
And we didn't set out to be that.

1662
02:01:48,280 --> 02:01:49,880
It's turned out that way.

1663
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:51,320
And we're not done.

1664
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:56,520
I mean, in terms of what may come along there,

1665
02:01:56,520 --> 02:02:00,840
and we have some direct operations there,

1666
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:10,320
as I mentioned, and we've got some really wonderful partners working for us, and I don't

1667
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:11,960
have to do anything.

1668
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:13,960
Okay, Becky.

1669
02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:23,360
>> The next question comes from Ellie Amin Tibet, who asks, "During an episode of 'Investing

1670
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:29,480
the Templeton Way' podcast, Professor Damodaran, who he respects almost as much as Warren and

1671
02:02:29,480 --> 02:02:34,260
Charlie mentioned that he is not comfortable with positions becoming a large part of his

1672
02:02:34,260 --> 02:02:39,980
portfolio. For example, when they reached 25 to 35 percent, he mentioned that Apple is

1673
02:02:39,980 --> 02:02:45,580
now 35 percent of Berkshire's portfolio and thinks that that is near a danger zone. Wonders

1674
02:02:45,580 --> 02:02:47,460
if Warren and Charlie can comment.

1675
02:02:47,460 --> 02:02:50,780
I'll leave him in one comment first, but Charlie will come up with-

1676
02:02:50,780 --> 02:02:52,260
I think he's not always one.

1677
02:02:52,260 --> 02:02:53,600
I knew that was coming.

1678
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:55,980
(audience laughing)

1679
02:02:55,980 --> 02:03:00,980
But, Apple is not 35% of Berkshire's portfolio.

1680
02:03:00,980 --> 02:03:03,820
Berkshire's portfolio includes the railroad,

1681
02:03:03,820 --> 02:03:08,140
the energy business, gradables, you name it, Sees Candy.

1682
02:03:08,140 --> 02:03:09,620
They're all businesses.

1683
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:14,060
And, you know, the good thing about Apple

1684
02:03:14,060 --> 02:03:16,900
is that we can go up.

1685
02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:20,540
They buy in their stock and instead of owning 5.6%,

1686
02:03:20,540 --> 02:03:24,980
You know, they got down to, they got about 15 billion,

1687
02:03:24,980 --> 02:03:28,380
700 and some million shares outstanding.

1688
02:03:28,380 --> 02:03:30,100
They got down to 15 and a quarter billion

1689
02:03:30,100 --> 02:03:31,060
without us doing anything.

1690
02:03:31,060 --> 02:03:32,420
We got 6%.

1691
02:03:32,420 --> 02:03:35,940
So we can't own more than 100% of the world.

1692
02:03:35,940 --> 02:03:40,220
BNSF, we can't own more than 100% of ground animals

1693
02:03:40,220 --> 02:03:41,620
or seized candy.

1694
02:03:41,620 --> 02:03:46,140
And it'd be nice, we'd love to own 200% but that just

1695
02:03:46,140 --> 02:03:46,980
is doable.

1696
02:03:46,980 --> 02:03:48,140
But they're all the same.

1697
02:03:48,140 --> 02:03:49,580
They're good businesses.

1698
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:54,580
And to think that our criterion, our criteria for Apple

1699
02:03:54,580 --> 02:03:59,540
is different than the other businesses we own.

1700
02:03:59,540 --> 02:04:04,140
It just happens to be a better business than any we own.

1701
02:04:04,140 --> 02:04:06,980
And we put a fair amount of money in it,

1702
02:04:06,980 --> 02:04:08,140
but we haven't got more money in it

1703
02:04:08,140 --> 02:04:09,740
than we've got in the railroad.

1704
02:04:09,740 --> 02:04:11,420
And Apple is a better business,

1705
02:04:11,420 --> 02:04:14,340
our railroad is a very good business,

1706
02:04:14,340 --> 02:04:17,320
but it's not remotely as good as Apple's business.

1707
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:24,220
Apple has a position with consumers where they're paying,

1708
02:04:24,220 --> 02:04:30,700
maybe they'll pay 1500 bucks or whatever it may be

1709
02:04:30,700 --> 02:04:34,660
for a phone and these same people pay $35,000

1710
02:04:34,660 --> 02:04:36,580
for having a second car.

1711
02:04:36,580 --> 02:04:38,660
And if they had to give up a second car

1712
02:04:38,660 --> 02:04:41,540
or give up their iPhone, they'd give up their second car.

1713
02:04:41,540 --> 02:04:44,060
I mean, it's an extraordinary,

1714
02:04:44,060 --> 02:04:45,380
probably we don't have anything like that

1715
02:04:45,380 --> 02:04:47,860
that we own 100% of,

1716
02:04:47,860 --> 02:04:51,340
but we're very, very, very happy to have 5.6

1717
02:04:51,340 --> 02:04:53,260
or whatever it may be, percent.

1718
02:04:53,260 --> 02:04:55,500
And we're delighted at every tenth of a percent

1719
02:04:55,500 --> 02:04:56,340
that goes up.

1720
02:04:56,340 --> 02:04:58,780
That's like adding $100 million to our earnings.

1721
02:04:58,780 --> 02:05:00,620
I mean, our share of the earnings.

1722
02:05:00,620 --> 02:05:03,700
And they use their earnings to buy out our partners,

1723
02:05:03,700 --> 02:05:06,740
which we're glad to see them sell out too.

1724
02:05:06,740 --> 02:05:08,380
The index funds have to sell out.

1725
02:05:08,380 --> 02:05:10,300
They bring the number of shares down.

1726
02:05:10,300 --> 02:05:15,300
And, you know, we went up slightly last year

1727
02:05:16,980 --> 02:05:19,620
And I made a mistake a couple of years ago

1728
02:05:19,620 --> 02:05:24,620
and I sold some shares when I had certain reasons why

1729
02:05:24,620 --> 02:05:31,140
gains were useful to take that year from a tag standpoint.

1730
02:05:31,140 --> 02:05:35,940
But having heard me say that, it was a dumb decision.

1731
02:05:35,940 --> 02:05:43,580
Charlie, you've already given your comment about it,

1732
02:05:43,580 --> 02:05:47,100
But we do not have 35% of Berkshire's portfolio.

1733
02:05:47,100 --> 02:05:51,660
Berkshire's portfolio is the funds we have to work with.

1734
02:05:51,660 --> 02:05:53,260
And we want to own good businesses,

1735
02:05:53,260 --> 02:05:55,900
and we also want to have plenty of liquidity.

1736
02:05:55,900 --> 02:06:00,060
And beyond that, the sky's the limit,

1737
02:06:00,060 --> 02:06:05,620
or our mistakes, who knows what the bottom is.

1738
02:06:05,620 --> 02:06:08,180
Charlie, do you want to add anything to your earlier comment?

1739
02:06:08,180 --> 02:06:14,940
Well, I think one of the inane things that's

1740
02:06:14,940 --> 02:06:18,580
taught in modern university education

1741
02:06:18,580 --> 02:06:21,900
is that a vast diversification is absolutely mandatory

1742
02:06:21,900 --> 02:06:25,300
and investing in common stocks.

1743
02:06:25,300 --> 02:06:28,140
That is an insane idea.

1744
02:06:28,140 --> 02:06:33,060
It's not that easy to have a vast plethora of good opportunities

1745
02:06:33,060 --> 02:06:35,100
that are easily identified.

1746
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:37,020
And if you've only got three, I'd rather

1747
02:06:37,020 --> 02:06:40,460
every of my best ideas instead of my worst.

1748
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:45,460
And now some people can't tell their best ideas

1749
02:06:45,460 --> 02:06:49,300
from their worst and in the act of deciding

1750
02:06:49,300 --> 02:06:51,580
that the investment already is good,

1751
02:06:51,580 --> 02:06:54,300
they get to thinking it's better than it is.

1752
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:58,640
I think we make fewer mistakes like that than other people.

1753
02:06:58,640 --> 02:07:00,780
And that is a blessing to us.

1754
02:07:00,780 --> 02:07:05,920
We're not so smart, but we kind of know

1755
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:09,080
where the edge of our smartness is.

1756
02:07:09,080 --> 02:07:13,480
That is a very important part of practical intelligence.

1757
02:07:13,480 --> 02:07:16,920
And a lot of people who are geniuses on IQ tests

1758
02:07:16,920 --> 02:07:18,760
think they're a lot smarter than they are.

1759
02:07:18,760 --> 02:07:20,360
And what they are is dangerous.

1760
02:07:20,360 --> 02:07:26,480
And, but if you know the edge of your own ability pretty well,

1761
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:31,320
you should ignore most of the notions of our experts

1762
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:36,320
about what I call "deworcification of portfolios."

1763
02:07:36,320 --> 02:07:40,120
- Okay.

1764
02:07:40,120 --> 02:07:43,280
(audience applauding)

1765
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:47,880
- Session nine.

1766
02:07:47,880 --> 02:07:53,600
- Hi, Charlie and Warren.

1767
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:58,040
Thank you for this superb shareholder meeting celebration.

1768
02:07:58,040 --> 02:08:00,200
My name is David Chung from Hong Kong

1769
02:08:00,200 --> 02:08:03,560
and a proud graduate of Chicago Booth.

1770
02:08:03,560 --> 02:08:06,840
I'm also here with my two sons, Aidan and Ashen,

1771
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:09,480
who's currently studying University of Chicago

1772
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:11,640
as a freshman and sophomore.

1773
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:16,180
This is my second time attending the conference,

1774
02:08:16,180 --> 02:08:19,800
last being 2019, four years ago,

1775
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:23,840
which I was only a guest shareholder of my friend Andrew.

1776
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:25,700
So after the shareholder meeting,

1777
02:08:25,700 --> 02:08:29,000
I have decided to buy into Berkshire Halfway,

1778
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:34,000
which has given me a great return of 62% since 2009.

1779
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
So I want to thank you for that.

1780
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:39,160
(audience applauding)

1781
02:08:39,160 --> 02:08:43,200
I have also taken one of your advice

1782
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:47,640
to give my children a share for each of their birthdays.

1783
02:08:47,640 --> 02:08:50,880
Although they won a Berger half away A shares,

1784
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:53,400
(audience laughing)

1785
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:55,640
they will do just fine with B shares.

1786
02:08:55,640 --> 02:08:58,640
(audience laughing)

1787
02:08:58,640 --> 02:09:06,640
My question is, how do you see the current US, China, internet companies valuation and

1788
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:08,960
the price disparity?

1789
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:14,960
Given there has been many uncertainties such as geo, political tensions, significant cost

1790
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:22,360
optimizations with leaner US tech firms, while China tech has been through all that already.

1791
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:23,360
Thank you.

1792
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:34,060
Charlie, I want to -- well, there's been some tension in the economic relationship of

1793
02:09:34,060 --> 02:09:36,000
United States and China.

1794
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:43,480
I think that tension has been wrongly created on both sides.

1795
02:09:43,480 --> 02:09:47,400
I think we're equally guilty of being stupid.

1796
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:48,640
There's one thing we should do.

1797
02:09:48,640 --> 02:09:54,700
Let's get along with China, and we should have a lot of free trade with China in our

1798
02:09:54,700 --> 02:10:00,000
mutual interest.

1799
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:04,720
I just can't imagine.

1800
02:10:04,720 --> 02:10:06,840
It's just so obvious.

1801
02:10:06,840 --> 02:10:11,240
There's so much safety and so much creativity that's possible.

1802
02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:21,960
what Apple has done by engaging in a partnership with China as a big supplier.

1803
02:10:21,960 --> 02:10:25,160
It's been good for Apple and good for China.

1804
02:10:25,160 --> 02:10:28,080
That's the kind of business we ought to be doing with China.

1805
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:30,360
And more of it.

1806
02:10:30,360 --> 02:10:35,960
Everything that increases the tension between the two companies is stupid, stupid, stupid.

1807
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:38,600
And it ought to be stopped on each side.

1808
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:44,440
And each side ought to respond to the other side's stupidity with reciprocal kindness.

1809
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:45,440
That's my view.

1810
02:10:45,440 --> 02:10:50,400
And it creates one enormous problem, of course, which is that you have the two superpowers

1811
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:55,800
of the world, and they know they have to get along with each other.

1812
02:10:55,800 --> 02:11:02,840
Either one can destroy the other, and they're going to be competitive with each other.

1813
02:11:02,840 --> 02:11:10,320
But part of it is trying always in a game like that, is trying to judge how far you

1814
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:14,880
can push the other guy without them reacting wrong.

1815
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:21,480
And you know, if either side is a bully in some way, they can get away with it to an

1816
02:11:21,480 --> 02:11:27,960
extent because the alternative is, would drive them both into destruction.

1817
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:32,800
But if they push it too far, they increase the probability that something really does

1818
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:33,800
go wrong.

1819
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:38,440
So it's, you know, it's one of those game theory dilemmas.

1820
02:11:38,440 --> 02:11:47,960
But you really need the leader of both countries.

1821
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:54,960
And you need the populace to understand at least the general situation in which these

1822
02:11:54,960 --> 02:12:02,080
countries are going to operate over the next century, and know that some leader that promises

1823
02:12:02,080 --> 02:12:06,400
too much can get you in a hell of a lot of trouble.

1824
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:11,400
And that, like, you know, you've got one kind of a system that gets its leader one way and

1825
02:12:11,400 --> 02:12:14,760
you've got another system that gets its leader another way.

1826
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:24,480
And keeping either side from trying to play the game too hard and thinking the other side

1827
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:35,280
will go along. It's like playing chicken and driving toward a cliff. So it is, if you've

1828
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:42,240
got any diplomacy skills, persuasive skills, or anything like that, you really want people

1829
02:12:42,240 --> 02:12:52,760
that will convince the other country as well as her own country that this is what we're

1830
02:12:52,760 --> 02:12:57,040
engaged in, we've got to do it right. We won't give away the store, but we won't

1831
02:12:57,040 --> 02:13:04,400
try and take the whole store either. We're just at the beginning of this,

1832
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:09,000
unfortunately. I mean, we learned what the situation was. It used to be the

1833
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:17,520
Soviet, and the mutually assured destruction was our policy then, and

1834
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:24,040
And that kept a lot of things from happening, but it also came with a very, very, very close

1835
02:13:24,040 --> 02:13:26,880
call with Cuba.

1836
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:34,240
And these are not, you know, these are different games than existed hundreds of years ago.

1837
02:13:34,240 --> 02:13:40,120
You could, you know, Britain might rule the seas, or France, or Spain, but now you're

1838
02:13:40,120 --> 02:13:45,440
playing with a game that you can't really make a huge mistake in.

1839
02:13:45,440 --> 02:13:52,720
And I think that that should be the better that's understood in both countries.

1840
02:13:52,720 --> 02:13:59,360
The more the leaders feel that their citizenry does understand that, the better off will

1841
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:00,360
be.

1842
02:14:00,360 --> 02:14:18,040
A lot of demography, a lot of inflammatory speaking, but a lot of authoritarian action.

1843
02:14:18,040 --> 02:14:22,080
I mean, it all carries its dangers.

1844
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:27,080
The world was stumbled through the years post-1945

1845
02:14:27,080 --> 02:14:32,500
with a lot of close calls from the, in the nuclear arena.

1846
02:14:32,500 --> 02:14:37,640
And now we've got pandemics and we've got,

1847
02:14:37,640 --> 02:14:40,720
we've got cyber and a whole bunch of other things.

1848
02:14:40,720 --> 02:14:43,080
So we've got more tools of destruction

1849
02:14:43,080 --> 02:14:46,120
than the world's ever had.

1850
02:14:46,120 --> 02:14:51,120
And it's imperative that China and the United States

1851
02:14:51,120 --> 02:14:55,720
and the United States both understand what the game is

1852
02:14:55,720 --> 02:14:58,620
and understand that you can't push too hard,

1853
02:14:58,620 --> 02:15:01,960
but both places are gonna be competitive

1854
02:15:01,960 --> 02:15:03,680
and both can prosper.

1855
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:08,320
That's what really is, that's the vision

1856
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:12,520
that is out there that China will have

1857
02:15:12,520 --> 02:15:14,960
a more wonderful country, the United States

1858
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:16,480
will have a more wonderful country

1859
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:21,840
And the two are not just compatible.

1860
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:27,000
They're almost imperative in terms of what's

1861
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,240
going to happen in the next 100 years or so.

1862
02:15:29,240 --> 02:15:36,480
And I think that the leaders of both countries

1863
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:43,160
have got an important job in having that understood

1864
02:15:43,160 --> 02:15:47,080
and not to do inflammatory things.

1865
02:15:47,080 --> 02:15:52,480
And we'll see whether the lock that has taken us from 1945

1866
02:15:52,480 --> 02:15:54,480
to present holds out.

1867
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:59,640
And I think we can affect, to some extent, that lock.

1868
02:15:59,640 --> 02:16:03,560
And with that sherry message, we will hold it to Becky.

1869
02:16:03,560 --> 02:16:06,440
This question comes from Rohit Bellany.

1870
02:16:06,440 --> 02:16:09,840
Berkshire bought a substantial position in Taiwan semiconductor

1871
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:12,200
and contrary to its normal holding timeline,

1872
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:16,040
sold almost the entire position within a few short months.

1873
02:16:16,040 --> 02:16:20,480
While you cited in a CNBC interview that geopolitical issues were the catalyst, these

1874
02:16:20,480 --> 02:16:24,700
issues were seemingly no different when you acquired that stock.

1875
02:16:24,700 --> 02:16:28,800
So what else, if anything, changed in those few months and prompted the firm to offload

1876
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:32,800
close to $5 billion worth of Taiwan semiconductor shares?

1877
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:42,180
Taiwan semiconductor is one of the best managed companies and important companies in the world.

1878
02:16:42,180 --> 02:16:50,860
And there is not, and I think you'll be able to say the same thing five or ten or twenty

1879
02:16:50,860 --> 02:16:52,860
years from now.

1880
02:16:52,860 --> 02:16:58,100
I don't like its location and I've re-evaluated that.

1881
02:16:58,100 --> 02:17:02,300
I mean I don't think there should be any place but Taiwan although they will be obviously

1882
02:17:02,300 --> 02:17:05,620
opening up ship capacity in this country.

1883
02:17:05,620 --> 02:17:13,540
And actually one of our subsidiaries that we got in Allegheny is participating in their

1884
02:17:13,540 --> 02:17:16,980
Arizona construction activities.

1885
02:17:16,980 --> 02:17:34,660
But it's a question of we would rather have the same kind of company.

1886
02:17:34,660 --> 02:17:39,220
There's nobody in the chip company, there's nobody in the chip industry that's in their

1887
02:17:39,220 --> 02:17:44,300
league in our, at least in my view.

1888
02:17:44,300 --> 02:17:51,380
And the man that was a 91 year old or so that connected with it that I think I played Bridge

1889
02:17:51,380 --> 02:17:55,380
with and Albuquerque.

1890
02:17:55,380 --> 02:18:03,540
And the marvelous people, marvelous company, but I'd rather find a marvelous people, I

1891
02:18:03,540 --> 02:18:05,500
I won't find it in the ship industry,

1892
02:18:05,500 --> 02:18:09,340
but marvelous people and marvelous competitive position

1893
02:18:09,340 --> 02:18:12,060
and everything, I'd rather find it in the United States.

1894
02:18:12,060 --> 02:18:17,060
I feel better about the capital that we've got deployed

1895
02:18:17,060 --> 02:18:20,820
in Japan than in Taiwan.

1896
02:18:20,820 --> 02:18:25,220
I wish I weren't so, but I think that's a reality

1897
02:18:25,220 --> 02:18:29,100
and I've reevaluated that in the light of certain things

1898
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:30,500
that were going on.

1899
02:18:30,500 --> 02:18:31,340
Charlie?

1900
02:18:31,340 --> 02:18:34,900
My view is that we're not feel comfortable if you want to.

1901
02:18:34,900 --> 02:18:38,740
[ Laughter ]

1902
02:18:38,740 --> 02:18:40,060
Put that in the minutes.

1903
02:18:40,060 --> 02:18:41,900
[ Laughter ]

1904
02:18:41,900 --> 02:18:43,900
Okay, station 10.

1905
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:51,860
>> First of all, thank you for making our lives better.

1906
02:18:51,860 --> 02:18:54,100
My name is Bogumil Baranowski.

1907
02:18:54,100 --> 02:18:58,100
I'm a founding partner of SIKAS Associates in New York.

1908
02:18:58,100 --> 02:19:01,380
We manage multi-generational family fortunes,

1909
02:19:01,380 --> 02:19:03,180
hence my question.

1910
02:19:03,180 --> 02:19:08,180
Mr. Buffett, in 1976, in your tribute to Benjamin Graham,

1911
02:19:08,180 --> 02:19:11,980
you wrote, "Walter Lippmann spoke of men

1912
02:19:11,980 --> 02:19:15,820
"who plan trees that other men will sit under.

1913
02:19:15,820 --> 02:19:18,420
"Ben Graham was such a man.

1914
02:19:18,420 --> 02:19:20,440
"You're both such people.

1915
02:19:20,440 --> 02:19:24,740
"Could you share with us your 100-year vision for Berkshire?"

1916
02:19:24,740 --> 02:19:26,500
It's a question to you both.

1917
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:33,260
Yeah, I would like to add one thing about Ben Graham.

1918
02:19:33,260 --> 02:19:38,260
Ben Graham did all kinds of things for me.

1919
02:19:38,260 --> 02:19:41,140
I never expected one thing in return.

1920
02:19:41,140 --> 02:19:49,100
I mean, just you name it, and he did it, and there wasn't any hidden, you know, a hint,

1921
02:19:49,100 --> 02:19:52,660
I should say, of anything he expected in return.

1922
02:19:52,660 --> 02:20:06,540
And I checked, well he wrote a book in 1949 that in a sense said to me in very persuasive

1923
02:20:06,540 --> 02:20:18,480
terms that what I had been spending the previous eight or nine years working at and loving

1924
02:20:18,480 --> 02:20:20,540
was all wrong.

1925
02:20:20,540 --> 02:20:29,340
And that book has been, I check it every now and then on Amazon to where it ranks, and

1926
02:20:29,340 --> 02:20:38,100
you know, Amazon ranks hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of books by sales.

1927
02:20:38,100 --> 02:20:46,380
And Ben Graham's book has been up there like number 300 or 350 or something like that forever.

1928
02:20:46,380 --> 02:20:48,860
And there isn't any book like that.

1929
02:20:48,860 --> 02:20:52,340
I wrote Harper Collins and Know The Other Day

1930
02:20:52,340 --> 02:20:54,660
'cause they're bringing out another edition.

1931
02:20:54,660 --> 02:20:57,140
And I asked them how many copies have been sold

1932
02:20:57,140 --> 02:21:00,180
and they said the records didn't go back far enough

1933
02:21:00,180 --> 02:21:05,180
but they had 7.3 million copies of this little book

1934
02:21:05,180 --> 02:21:12,540
that changed my life and continues to outsell

1935
02:21:12,540 --> 02:21:16,020
every investment book.

1936
02:21:16,020 --> 02:21:21,020
Investment comes along and they're number 400 or 1,000

1937
02:21:21,020 --> 02:21:22,700
or something for a while

1938
02:21:22,700 --> 02:21:26,980
and then all of a sudden they're number 25,000 or 200,000.

1939
02:21:26,980 --> 02:21:31,980
And this book, in how many areas can you find any book

1940
02:21:31,980 --> 02:21:38,260
that has had that sustained position?

1941
02:21:38,260 --> 02:21:41,140
You go back and look at number one at 1950

1942
02:21:41,140 --> 02:21:43,100
or number two or number three

1943
02:21:43,100 --> 02:21:45,100
and you look at them 51 and 52.

1944
02:21:45,100 --> 02:21:46,340
They don't continue.

1945
02:21:46,340 --> 02:21:47,900
I mean, they just don't continue.

1946
02:21:47,900 --> 02:21:52,960
Cookbooks, maybe one or two of them last for a while,

1947
02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:55,140
but there is nothing.

1948
02:21:55,140 --> 02:21:58,440
And this book lives on and everybody keeps bringing out

1949
02:21:58,440 --> 02:22:01,520
new books and saying a lot of other things,

1950
02:22:01,520 --> 02:22:03,700
but they aren't saying anything that's as important

1951
02:22:03,700 --> 02:22:07,700
as what he said in 1949 in this relatively thin little book.

1952
02:22:07,700 --> 02:22:12,700
So, our vision for Berkshire is to get

1953
02:22:12,700 --> 02:22:16,740
For Berkshire, this is exactly what we said today.

1954
02:22:16,740 --> 02:22:24,620
We want it to be a company that is owned by its shareholders and behaves in a way that

1955
02:22:24,620 --> 02:22:29,260
society is happy that it exists and not unhappy.

1956
02:22:29,260 --> 02:22:33,940
And we will have unlimited capital.

1957
02:22:33,940 --> 02:22:36,220
We'll get lots of talent.

1958
02:22:36,220 --> 02:22:40,380
And we've got a base that can't be beat.

1959
02:22:40,380 --> 02:22:47,860
And there's no reason why it can't be perpetuated just like Ben's book and maybe be an example

1960
02:22:47,860 --> 02:22:50,100
to other people.

1961
02:22:50,100 --> 02:22:52,140
And if so, we'll be very happy.

1962
02:22:52,140 --> 02:22:53,140
Charlie?

1963
02:22:53,140 --> 02:22:59,100
Yeah, one of the really interesting things about Ben and Gary, he was a really gifted

1964
02:22:59,100 --> 02:23:04,300
teacher, a very honorable profession.

1965
02:23:04,300 --> 02:23:07,980
And that is what has lasted.

1966
02:23:07,980 --> 02:23:15,380
However, an interesting fact that he was sheepish about in his old age was that more than half

1967
02:23:15,380 --> 02:23:21,100
of all the investment return that Benningram made in his whole life came from one stock,

1968
02:23:21,100 --> 02:23:27,500
one growth stock, GEICO, Berger's subsidiary.

1969
02:23:27,500 --> 02:23:34,780
And at the time he operated, there were a lot of sort of lousy companies that were too

1970
02:23:34,780 --> 02:23:40,420
cheap and you could make a little money floating from one to another. But the big money he

1971
02:23:40,420 --> 02:23:49,180
made was one growth stock. Buying one undervalued great company is a very good thing as Berkshire

1972
02:23:49,180 --> 02:23:53,720
has found out again and again and again.

1973
02:23:53,720 --> 02:24:02,280
And Ben wrote a post-crypt of the '49 edition pointing out exactly that fact and acknowledging

1974
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:06,560
it but also took some good lessons from it.

1975
02:24:06,560 --> 02:24:15,280
That's the way life is, that you prepare and you don't lose everything along the way.

1976
02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:17,120
And then something comes along.

1977
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:26,040
And Geico came along because a banker in Fort Worth that had financed Leo Davison, and I

1978
02:24:26,040 --> 02:24:31,320
think the banker got three quarters of it, and I don't mean Leo Davison, Leo Goodwin,

1979
02:24:31,320 --> 02:24:36,500
founded Geico, then called Government Employees Insurance Company, and you can figure out the

1980
02:24:36,500 --> 02:24:45,460
acronym. And the deal almost fell apart. The deal was, as I remember, maybe a million

1981
02:24:45,460 --> 02:24:50,020
and a half or something like a million and a quarter. And it almost fell apart because

1982
02:24:50,020 --> 02:24:57,500
of a difference of $25,000 in the net worth delivered. This is a business that's, you

1983
02:24:57,500 --> 02:24:59,460
You know, we're tens of billions.

1984
02:24:59,460 --> 02:25:03,260
But he pointed out the irony in that too.

1985
02:25:03,260 --> 02:25:05,540
I mean, he was honest about,

1986
02:25:05,540 --> 02:25:10,180
he was totally intellectually honest about his,

1987
02:25:10,180 --> 02:25:14,840
the failings and also the strengths of his approach.

1988
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:19,020
And that to some extent, you know,

1989
02:25:19,020 --> 02:25:20,840
Charlie and I have seen that in our lives.

1990
02:25:20,840 --> 02:25:23,380
I mean, sort of the prepared mind,

1991
02:25:23,380 --> 02:25:27,100
the willingness to act when you need to act

1992
02:25:27,100 --> 02:25:30,500
and the willingness to ignore every salesman in the world

1993
02:25:30,500 --> 02:25:33,380
and imperative to ignore them.

1994
02:25:33,380 --> 02:25:38,380
And it's one or two things that make the right decision.

1995
02:25:38,380 --> 02:25:40,580
If you make the right decision on a spouse,

1996
02:25:40,580 --> 02:25:42,220
I mean, you've won the game.

1997
02:25:42,220 --> 02:25:47,980
And there's enormous important decision

1998
02:25:47,980 --> 02:25:49,700
and you got all the time.

1999
02:25:49,700 --> 02:25:52,060
I mean, in the world, you got more time now

2000
02:25:52,060 --> 02:25:54,020
than you used to have when I was kid

2001
02:25:54,020 --> 02:25:56,500
to make that decision.

2002
02:25:56,500 --> 02:26:04,420
And I don't know whether a third or whatever percentage

2003
02:26:04,420 --> 02:26:06,220
blow that one.

2004
02:26:06,220 --> 02:26:08,820
It is really interesting.

2005
02:26:08,820 --> 02:26:14,060
The thing to do is just keep trying to think things through

2006
02:26:14,060 --> 02:26:16,060
and not do too many stupid things.

2007
02:26:16,060 --> 02:26:19,260
And sooner or later, you'll have a lot of plows,

2008
02:26:19,260 --> 02:26:22,500
as Shirley would say.

2009
02:26:22,500 --> 02:26:24,900
OK, Becky.

2010
02:26:24,900 --> 02:26:27,300
>> All right, this question comes from Tarafter,

2011
02:26:27,300 --> 02:26:29,980
a shareholder in Sierra Vista, Arizona,

2012
02:26:29,980 --> 02:26:33,180
who is asking a question of a jeep.

2013
02:26:33,180 --> 02:26:36,660
He wants to know about electric vehicles getting insurance

2014
02:26:36,660 --> 02:26:39,980
from the manufacturer instead of car insurance companies.

2015
02:26:39,980 --> 02:26:41,900
A recent article in the Wall Street Journal shows

2016
02:26:41,900 --> 02:26:45,300
that the EVs are a small but growing percentage of sales.

2017
02:26:45,300 --> 02:26:49,460
Tesla and GM are offering their own electric vehicle insurance.

2018
02:26:49,460 --> 02:26:52,580
What will GEICO do to combat this?

2019
02:26:53,700 --> 02:26:57,500
Yeah, so Geico is talking to a number of original equipment

2020
02:26:57,500 --> 02:27:01,820
manufacturers as well to try and see how best they can work

2021
02:27:01,820 --> 02:27:04,380
with the auto manufacturer and offer insurance

2022
02:27:04,380 --> 02:27:06,420
at the point of sale.

2023
02:27:06,420 --> 02:27:10,900
There haven't been very many success stories as yet.

2024
02:27:10,900 --> 02:27:13,860
So we'll wait and see.

2025
02:27:13,860 --> 02:27:16,700
Clearly, it is a very convenient way

2026
02:27:16,700 --> 02:27:19,940
to sell auto insurance at the point of sale.

2027
02:27:19,940 --> 02:27:22,260
But there's a fair amount of data

2028
02:27:22,260 --> 02:27:25,620
that needs to be collected on the driver, not just the car.

2029
02:27:25,620 --> 02:27:27,820
And that makes it a little more complicated.

2030
02:27:27,820 --> 02:27:32,940
So we are talking to some auto manufacturers ourselves.

2031
02:27:32,940 --> 02:27:36,460
We are hopeful too that we will strike a deal with some of them

2032
02:27:36,460 --> 02:27:38,420
before not too long.

2033
02:27:38,420 --> 02:27:40,580
Tesla has made the--

2034
02:27:40,580 --> 02:27:44,060
and GM, they both have talked a lot in the press in terms

2035
02:27:44,060 --> 02:27:46,260
of getting into their insurance business.

2036
02:27:46,260 --> 02:27:49,180
And in fact, GM, I think, has projected.

2037
02:27:49,180 --> 02:27:51,180
They'll write $3 billion of premium,

2038
02:27:51,180 --> 02:27:54,620
which, you know, it's hard to imagine where it'll come from.

2039
02:27:54,620 --> 02:27:57,060
But they're all hard to trot.

2040
02:27:57,060 --> 02:27:59,380
I think somebody will find the secret sauce

2041
02:27:59,380 --> 02:28:03,120
before not too long and we ourselves are in that race.

2042
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:07,620
- Yeah, I would point out that General Motors

2043
02:28:07,620 --> 02:28:10,820
had Motors insurance for decades.

2044
02:28:10,820 --> 02:28:13,620
And I mean, this is not a new idea.

2045
02:28:13,620 --> 02:28:15,980
And Uber,

2046
02:28:15,980 --> 02:28:24,300
Uber, no lot of insurance for a while, they laid it off with somebody and that company

2047
02:28:24,300 --> 02:28:29,300
got killed by it, and I don't know the deal between Uber and, forget the name of the company

2048
02:28:29,300 --> 02:28:32,100
that took it on, Jeet would probably know, but...

2049
02:28:32,100 --> 02:28:33,100
James River.

2050
02:28:33,100 --> 02:28:43,340
Yeah, and you know, there's nothing, it's not a new idea, it's not magic in the least.

2051
02:28:43,340 --> 02:28:48,340
I mean, it is hard to come up with something that is better

2052
02:28:48,340 --> 02:28:53,600
at missing and matching risk to reward,

2053
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:57,540
I'm sorry, risk to prize.

2054
02:28:57,540 --> 02:29:01,540
Then a bunch of very smart people are doing it,

2055
02:29:01,540 --> 02:29:03,580
a progressive and a bunch of very smart people

2056
02:29:03,580 --> 02:29:06,860
are doing it to a greater extent at Geico.

2057
02:29:06,860 --> 02:29:11,420
And I mean, it is, it just,

2058
02:29:11,420 --> 02:29:14,540
It was fascinating to me when Uber went into it, you know,

2059
02:29:14,540 --> 02:29:17,140
and they were going to get their head handed to them,

2060
02:29:17,140 --> 02:29:19,500
but they laid off a good bit of it,

2061
02:29:19,500 --> 02:29:22,660
a very substantial percentage of it was somebody else

2062
02:29:22,660 --> 02:29:24,540
who got their head handed to it.

2063
02:29:24,540 --> 02:29:28,660
And, you know, but it was a story, you know,

2064
02:29:28,660 --> 02:29:30,460
Wall Street loves it.

2065
02:29:30,460 --> 02:29:39,700
We've got 80 car dealerships that do a lot of business.

2066
02:29:39,700 --> 02:29:43,320
And, you know, we've got the people buying the car

2067
02:29:43,320 --> 02:29:48,360
and the place and we form an insurance company around the

2068
02:29:48,360 --> 02:29:52,200
dealer group for some reason that writes insurance.

2069
02:29:52,200 --> 02:29:56,520
You know, it's hard to improve on the present system.

2070
02:29:56,520 --> 02:29:57,820
>> Yeah.

2071
02:29:57,820 --> 02:30:00,920
>> I have no -- I wouldn't pay a penny.

2072
02:30:00,920 --> 02:30:02,760
I'd pay to avoid it actually.

2073
02:30:02,760 --> 02:30:05,560
I mean, and go ahead, Ajit.

2074
02:30:05,560 --> 02:30:08,600
>> Yeah, the only point I'd like to add is the margins

2075
02:30:08,600 --> 02:30:12,960
on writing auto insurance are 4%, which is a very small number.

2076
02:30:12,960 --> 02:30:17,520
And once there are more people that are trying to take a bite of the apple, it just becomes

2077
02:30:17,520 --> 02:30:23,160
very, very difficult to keep all the mouths fed in a profitable manner.

2078
02:30:23,160 --> 02:30:32,080
>> Now, you can say that there was one big new idea in insurance and car insurance back

2079
02:30:32,080 --> 02:30:35,520
in 1920 or so when State Farm started.

2080
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:44,760
State Farm and still has it next to Berkshire. It's the leader in having that worth. It's

2081
02:30:44,760 --> 02:30:50,960
a mutual company, but some guy just figured that there was a cartel running car insurance

2082
02:30:50,960 --> 02:30:58,960
and he, farmer from Urna, the name of the book I think, over in Illinois, he created

2083
02:30:58,960 --> 02:31:05,440
a system where you really took 20 points or so out of the costs. And surprise, surprise

2084
02:31:05,440 --> 02:31:12,440
areas. You know, and nobody's own stock and state farm. It's an insult to capitalism,

2085
02:31:12,440 --> 02:31:17,760
actually. Everything you learn at the business school says it shouldn't work because nobody

2086
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:22,720
owns it, nobody's going public with it, no nothing. But it's got more net worth. It's

2087
02:31:22,720 --> 02:31:26,920
almost probably double leaving Berkshire in the picture. It's probably double the next

2088
02:31:26,920 --> 02:31:32,080
guy and nobody's really improved on their system that much.

2089
02:31:32,080 --> 02:31:40,320
So it's fascinating how people don't really look at the essence.

2090
02:31:40,320 --> 02:31:46,040
These are cases that should carry a message.

2091
02:31:46,040 --> 02:31:49,400
But the truth is in Wall Street, anything that gets -- the test is whether you can sell

2092
02:31:49,400 --> 02:31:50,400
it or not.

2093
02:31:50,400 --> 02:31:53,520
If you can sell it, it will get sold.

2094
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:58,440
And a bunch of insurance companies came along and got it sold, and this can be a story about

2095
02:31:58,440 --> 02:31:59,960
this stock or that stock.

2096
02:31:59,960 --> 02:32:03,880
And it sounded good when they talked about it at Uber for a while.

2097
02:32:03,880 --> 02:32:06,240
It is really interesting.

2098
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:09,640
The investing public does not learn much.

2099
02:32:09,640 --> 02:32:13,240
Okay, station 11.

2100
02:32:13,240 --> 02:32:17,520
>> Hi, my name is Jeff Merriam.

2101
02:32:17,520 --> 02:32:19,520
I'm from Edina, Minnesota.

2102
02:32:19,520 --> 02:32:25,320
You've been coming for years to make that professor from the earlier question really nervous.

2103
02:32:25,320 --> 02:32:28,120
Half our family's wealth is in Berkshire Hathaway.

2104
02:32:28,120 --> 02:32:32,800
Well, that doesn't make Charlie nervous.

2105
02:32:32,800 --> 02:32:36,140
My question has to do with voting control in the future.

2106
02:32:36,140 --> 02:32:38,520
There was a question earlier about corporate raider.

2107
02:32:38,520 --> 02:32:44,240
I was more wondering about who is actually going to own the voting control.

2108
02:32:44,240 --> 02:32:48,820
Is it going to be institutions, CalPERS, BlackRock?

2109
02:32:48,820 --> 02:32:55,320
Are they eventually going to get their way with the ESG checkboxes that we're going to

2110
02:32:55,320 --> 02:32:56,320
have to check?

2111
02:32:56,320 --> 02:32:58,400
And what should we be thinking about that?

2112
02:32:58,400 --> 02:33:01,160
Well, you're thinking very well.

2113
02:33:01,160 --> 02:33:10,080
And the interesting thing is the big aggregations look like, of course, they'd be in index funds.

2114
02:33:10,080 --> 02:33:18,620
But what index funds want is they want a world in which society doesn't get upset with them

2115
02:33:18,620 --> 02:33:20,580
about the fact that I've got all the voting power.

2116
02:33:20,580 --> 02:33:23,500
And I would say in the last year or two,

2117
02:33:23,500 --> 02:33:30,340
it's looked like a better idea for them not quite together.

2118
02:33:30,340 --> 02:33:37,060
What was the phrase that Charlie used?

2119
02:33:37,060 --> 02:33:38,380
I've been...

2120
02:33:38,380 --> 02:33:40,020
- They backed off a lot.

2121
02:33:40,020 --> 02:33:42,060
- Yeah, they backed off a lot.

2122
02:33:42,060 --> 02:33:44,740
And they're interested to back out often.

2123
02:33:44,740 --> 02:33:46,860
Interestingly enough,

2124
02:33:48,500 --> 02:33:55,700
And looking at money management, you know, the game is not performance, it's assets

2125
02:33:55,700 --> 02:33:57,540
under management.

2126
02:33:57,540 --> 02:34:05,340
And index funds produce a tiny, tiny, tiny fee on assets under management because it

2127
02:34:05,340 --> 02:34:08,580
was pioneered by Vanguard.

2128
02:34:08,580 --> 02:34:13,260
And it's -- when it became successful, it was very easy to replicate.

2129
02:34:13,260 --> 02:34:19,300
not so easy, but I mean it was inevitable that it would be copied.

2130
02:34:19,300 --> 02:34:23,060
But it came with a management fee of two basis points.

2131
02:34:23,060 --> 02:34:29,620
So what people that have offered index funds would really like is you to buy their other

2132
02:34:29,620 --> 02:34:37,980
funds or let them manage money in some other way so that they get a higher fee on assets

2133
02:34:37,980 --> 02:34:38,980
under management.

2134
02:34:38,980 --> 02:34:43,460
which of course is exactly why the index fund was invented in the first place.

2135
02:34:43,460 --> 02:34:51,140
But so it's gotten, it's not a lost leader, but it is a way to pull money in.

2136
02:34:51,140 --> 02:34:57,700
And then you hope that people ignore what was said by, by, what's the name that, you know,

2137
02:34:57,700 --> 02:35:05,300
that John Bogal, Jack Bogal, ignore him. And essentially they give up the idea and that

2138
02:35:05,300 --> 02:35:07,640
We'll offer you a fund that does this in India,

2139
02:35:07,640 --> 02:35:09,240
and we'll offer you another fund that does that,

2140
02:35:09,240 --> 02:35:11,680
and of course those management fees are higher.

2141
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:14,720
So they're really counter selling the idea

2142
02:35:14,720 --> 02:35:16,520
that John Bogle came along with.

2143
02:35:16,520 --> 02:35:21,000
But in the process, they have achieved a lot of votes,

2144
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:24,320
and that was fun for a while,

2145
02:35:24,320 --> 02:35:26,760
but the last thing in the world I wanted to do

2146
02:35:26,760 --> 02:35:29,280
is have Washington, or the American public,

2147
02:35:29,280 --> 02:35:32,440
decide that they're throwing around their weight too much.

2148
02:35:32,440 --> 02:35:34,880
So they're tending to back off now.

2149
02:35:34,880 --> 02:35:37,460
If you figure out where their self-interest is,

2150
02:35:37,460 --> 02:35:39,880
you can judge where their behavior is going to go.

2151
02:35:39,880 --> 02:35:45,200
Charlie, you want to defend them?

2152
02:35:45,200 --> 02:35:47,520
- No, you can swear at me while you just said.

2153
02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:48,560
(laughing)

2154
02:35:48,560 --> 02:35:50,400
You're totally right on everything.

2155
02:35:50,400 --> 02:35:54,220
- Well, in that case, I won't ask anybody else.

2156
02:35:54,220 --> 02:35:55,520
Okay, Becky?

2157
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:58,280
(laughing)

2158
02:35:58,280 --> 02:36:02,680
- All right, this question comes from Almu Grinnell,

2159
02:36:02,680 --> 02:36:07,160
And it's about, this is for Warren and Greg.

2160
02:36:07,160 --> 02:36:10,760
Since 2019, Berkshire repurchased huge amounts of stock

2161
02:36:10,760 --> 02:36:13,680
about approximately reducing 10% of the share count

2162
02:36:13,680 --> 02:36:15,840
and increasing the intrinsic value per share

2163
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:17,880
for the continuing shareholders.

2164
02:36:17,880 --> 02:36:21,400
Greg is expected to be the successor of Warren as CEO,

2165
02:36:21,400 --> 02:36:23,360
so will he be in charge of the main

2166
02:36:23,360 --> 02:36:25,000
capital allocation decisions,

2167
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,280
including future share buybacks?

2168
02:36:27,280 --> 02:36:28,760
Greg has been key in the development

2169
02:36:28,760 --> 02:36:29,960
of Berkshire Hathaway Energy,

2170
02:36:29,960 --> 02:36:32,160
and I think a good capital allocator.

2171
02:36:32,160 --> 02:36:38,200
Has he been involved in the share repurchases that have been executed over the past years?

2172
02:36:38,200 --> 02:36:42,400
And do you, both Warren and Greg, work together in the estimation of Berkshire's intrinsic

2173
02:36:42,400 --> 02:36:44,720
value and the share buyback decisions?

2174
02:36:44,720 --> 02:36:50,120
Well, the answer is that Greg -- I'm going to turn it over to him, but the answer is

2175
02:36:50,120 --> 02:36:56,240
Greg understands capital allocation as well as I do, and that's lucky for us.

2176
02:36:56,240 --> 02:37:01,800
And he will make those decisions, I think, very much in the same framework as I would

2177
02:37:01,800 --> 02:37:02,640
and make them.

2178
02:37:02,640 --> 02:37:06,000
And we've laid out that framework now for 30 years

2179
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:07,320
or something like that.

2180
02:37:07,320 --> 02:37:09,680
People make it way more complicated.

2181
02:37:09,680 --> 02:37:11,680
I mean, particularly if you're working on a doctorate

2182
02:37:11,680 --> 02:37:13,080
or something, it's just a great subject

2183
02:37:13,080 --> 02:37:16,880
to have lots of footnotes and 50 pages or 100 pages.

2184
02:37:16,880 --> 02:37:21,840
But it's no more complicated than if you and I

2185
02:37:21,840 --> 02:37:25,440
and Charlie had a business and you wanted to sell

2186
02:37:25,440 --> 02:37:28,040
your interest and we could buy it for less

2187
02:37:28,040 --> 02:37:29,680
than we thought it was worth.

2188
02:37:29,680 --> 02:37:33,880
and without misleading you in any way about what was going on,

2189
02:37:33,880 --> 02:37:35,920
and we'd buy it then.

2190
02:37:35,920 --> 02:37:38,000
But Greg, you're on because you're

2191
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:39,480
going to be doing it in the future.

2192
02:37:39,480 --> 02:37:41,480
Right.

2193
02:37:41,480 --> 02:37:43,520
Yeah, well, I think Warren, you said it really well.

2194
02:37:43,520 --> 02:37:45,200
I mean, the framework's been laid out.

2195
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:50,360
We know how you approach it and how you and Charlie have

2196
02:37:50,360 --> 02:37:53,720
approached it, and really don't see that framework changing.

2197
02:37:53,720 --> 02:37:56,000
When the opportunity presents itself,

2198
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:59,660
we'll want to be an active repurchaser of Berkshire shares.

2199
02:37:59,660 --> 02:38:03,020
We think it's a great outcome for Berkshire Sherholders

2200
02:38:03,020 --> 02:38:06,580
to own a larger piece of each of our operating businesses

2201
02:38:06,580 --> 02:38:10,260
and the portfolio, the equity companies,

2202
02:38:10,260 --> 02:38:13,160
when the opportunity presents itself.

2203
02:38:13,160 --> 02:38:14,780
- It can be the dumbest thing you can do,

2204
02:38:14,780 --> 02:38:17,060
or it can be the smartest thing you can do.

2205
02:38:17,060 --> 02:38:21,540
And to make it more complicated than that

2206
02:38:21,540 --> 02:38:23,460
and start getting into all this,

2207
02:38:23,460 --> 02:38:27,220
but you obviously do what the business needs to do first,

2208
02:38:27,220 --> 02:38:31,100
that the opportunities are there, grow your present business,

2209
02:38:31,100 --> 02:38:33,020
buy additional business, whatever it may be.

2210
02:38:33,020 --> 02:38:36,580
And then you make a decision on dividends,

2211
02:38:36,580 --> 02:38:38,660
but that decision becomes pretty irrevocable

2212
02:38:38,660 --> 02:38:40,500
because you don't cut dividends

2213
02:38:40,500 --> 02:38:45,500
without having major effects in your shareholder base

2214
02:38:45,500 --> 02:38:47,300
and a lot of things.

2215
02:38:47,300 --> 02:38:51,780
And then if you got ample capital

2216
02:38:51,780 --> 02:38:54,060
and you don't see that you're going to use it all

2217
02:38:54,060 --> 02:38:59,060
and your stock is attractive and enhances the intrinsic value

2218
02:38:59,060 --> 02:39:01,700
for the remaining shareholders, it's an old brainer.

2219
02:39:01,700 --> 02:39:04,860
And if it's above the price of intrinsic value,

2220
02:39:04,860 --> 02:39:07,060
it's a no brainer that you don't even listen to anybody,

2221
02:39:07,060 --> 02:39:09,380
no matter what investment banker comes in

2222
02:39:09,380 --> 02:39:12,580
and tells you here's how to do a repurchase program.

2223
02:39:12,580 --> 02:39:15,420
Okay, station one.

2224
02:39:15,420 --> 02:39:22,420
- I'm Tom Nelson, a podcast here

2225
02:39:22,420 --> 02:39:24,940
from North Oaks, Minnesota.

2226
02:39:24,940 --> 02:39:29,740
Charlie, in 2022, you used phrases like,

2227
02:39:29,740 --> 02:39:34,660
really massively stupid, massive kind of ignorance,

2228
02:39:34,660 --> 02:39:37,900
and crazy to describe what you said

2229
02:39:37,900 --> 02:39:42,500
was the 30% of Americans hesitant to submit themselves

2230
02:39:42,500 --> 02:39:47,180
to untested mRNA COVID gene therapy.

2231
02:39:47,180 --> 02:39:50,020
Do you stand behind those quotes today?

2232
02:39:50,020 --> 02:39:50,980
- Yeah, sure.

2233
02:39:51,980 --> 02:40:00,540
[APPLAUSE]

2234
02:40:00,540 --> 02:40:02,700
Well, we got time for one more than before lunch.

2235
02:40:02,700 --> 02:40:05,420
[LAUGHTER]

2236
02:40:05,420 --> 02:40:07,060
Becky?

2237
02:40:07,060 --> 02:40:08,060
OK.

2238
02:40:08,060 --> 02:40:10,540
[LAUGHTER]

2239
02:40:10,540 --> 02:40:11,940
I was out, but let's see.

2240
02:40:11,940 --> 02:40:15,260
[APPLAUSE]

2241
02:40:15,260 --> 02:40:16,540
How about--

2242
02:40:16,540 --> 02:40:17,540
[INAUDIBLE]

2243
02:40:17,540 --> 02:40:18,540
--see here.

2244
02:40:18,540 --> 02:40:21,900
[INAUDIBLE]

2245
02:40:21,900 --> 02:40:23,900
It's going to be how about lunch pretty soon.

2246
02:40:23,900 --> 02:40:24,900
I know.

2247
02:40:24,900 --> 02:40:25,900
OK.

2248
02:40:25,900 --> 02:40:26,900
I've got one for you.

2249
02:40:26,900 --> 02:40:29,700
This one comes from Drew Estes.

2250
02:40:29,700 --> 02:40:30,860
This is a question for Warren.

2251
02:40:30,860 --> 02:40:35,940
In your 1969 letter to partners, you said, "In any company where the founder and chief

2252
02:40:35,940 --> 02:40:40,140
driving force behind the enterprise is still active, it's still very difficult to evaluate

2253
02:40:40,140 --> 02:40:41,540
second men.

2254
02:40:41,540 --> 02:40:45,900
The only real way to see how someone is going to do when running a company is to let them

2255
02:40:45,900 --> 02:40:47,300
run it."

2256
02:40:47,300 --> 02:40:49,460
This wise statement now applies to Berkshire.

2257
02:40:49,460 --> 02:40:53,620
the second man are running Berkshire, what would you advise owners of Berkshire to watch

2258
02:40:53,620 --> 02:40:57,340
for, specifically what actions, if taken, should give us concern?

2259
02:40:57,340 --> 02:41:03,620
Well, I think I would have some comfort in the fact that 99% of my net worth is in that

2260
02:41:03,620 --> 02:41:04,620
company.

2261
02:41:04,620 --> 02:41:10,620
So I probably got a stronger interest in it, and perhaps 100 billion or more of philanthropy

2262
02:41:10,620 --> 02:41:14,620
will be affected by it.

2263
02:41:14,620 --> 02:41:19,840
But I would say that I don't have a second choice.

2264
02:41:19,840 --> 02:41:27,040
I mean, it is that tough to find, but I've also seen Greg in action.

2265
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:37,080
I feel 100% comfortable and like they say, I don't know.

2266
02:41:37,080 --> 02:41:38,080
Something happened to Greg.

2267
02:41:38,080 --> 02:41:42,900
I would tell the directors, you know, they have a problem and they won't.

2268
02:41:42,900 --> 02:41:49,420
I don't have anybody to name and if they put somebody in, Berkshire on automatic pilot

2269
02:41:49,420 --> 02:41:52,820
can work extremely well for a long time.

2270
02:41:52,820 --> 02:41:59,260
I mean, it doesn't like the businesses go away or anything, sort.

2271
02:41:59,260 --> 02:42:01,260
And you can't.

2272
02:42:01,260 --> 02:42:09,020
It's hard to judge successor management in a really good business because if they don't

2273
02:42:09,020 --> 02:42:12,060
show up at the office it'll keep working for a long time.

2274
02:42:12,060 --> 02:42:21,420
And maybe that useful input may show itself in five years.

2275
02:42:21,420 --> 02:42:25,340
It may go a long, long, long time.

2276
02:42:25,340 --> 02:42:36,700
And how are the shareholders advised by a bunch of people that are concerned about whether

2277
02:42:36,700 --> 02:42:40,780
you're meeting earnings projections or something, telling them whether the management's any

2278
02:42:40,780 --> 02:42:46,140
good thing. You know, it is very, very hard. It's very hard. I've been on the board of

2279
02:42:46,140 --> 02:42:54,420
20 companies. It's very hard. If you ask me to rank the management of each one, it's very

2280
02:42:54,420 --> 02:42:58,860
difficult to do because some are just better businesses than others. Some would be better

2281
02:42:58,860 --> 02:43:04,980
off not managed hardly at all. Others really need help, but they got a lousy business.

2282
02:43:04,980 --> 02:43:10,660
And Tom Murphy told me a long, long, long time ago, he said the secret of business is

2283
02:43:10,660 --> 02:43:12,460
to buy a good business.

2284
02:43:12,460 --> 02:43:15,540
And it's okay to inherit one too.

2285
02:43:15,540 --> 02:43:20,060
And Greg is inheriting a good business and I think it will make it better.

2286
02:43:20,060 --> 02:43:25,940
But I don't think it's easy to put any one of the next ten nominees in and try and judge

2287
02:43:25,940 --> 02:43:28,220
three years later whether they've done a good job or not.

2288
02:43:28,220 --> 02:43:33,460
So it's going to be a, that'll be a very interesting job for the board.

2289
02:43:33,460 --> 02:43:36,500
and they shouldn't listen to Wall Street on it.

2290
02:43:36,500 --> 02:43:38,100
They've got the job.

2291
02:43:38,100 --> 02:43:40,700
If they put somebody in, there's a surprise.

2292
02:43:40,700 --> 02:43:43,380
We both go down on a plane, they put somebody in.

2293
02:43:43,380 --> 02:43:45,820
They've got a real job in assessing that person.

2294
02:43:45,820 --> 02:43:49,940
It'll depend on how good he or she is as a talker.

2295
02:43:49,940 --> 02:43:53,420
It'll depend on them courting Wall Street

2296
02:43:53,420 --> 02:43:55,460
to be supportive of all kinds of things.

2297
02:43:55,460 --> 02:44:00,460
And we've got some very good people on the board,

2298
02:44:00,460 --> 02:44:03,340
but they would be challenged in that position

2299
02:44:03,340 --> 02:44:06,940
as would I where I've been in that position

2300
02:44:06,940 --> 02:44:11,940
in other companies where a very great leader has left.

2301
02:44:11,940 --> 02:44:15,100
And on the way back from the funeral,

2302
02:44:15,100 --> 02:44:17,940
you know, nobody knows what to do exactly.

2303
02:44:17,940 --> 02:44:20,940
So with that cheery message, we will go to lunch

2304
02:44:20,940 --> 02:44:23,020
and we will come back.

2305
02:44:23,020 --> 02:44:26,180
(audience applauding)

2306
02:44:26,180 --> 02:44:31,580
We'll see you at one o'clock.

2307
02:44:31,580 --> 02:44:33,020
Thank you, Owen.

2308
02:44:33,020 --> 02:44:35,820
And we're still gonna try and get 60 questions in.

2309
02:44:35,820 --> 02:44:37,300
We've done 25 so far.

2310
02:44:37,300 --> 02:44:39,580
Yeah, 25.

2311
02:44:39,580 --> 02:44:41,580
So keep the question short

2312
02:44:41,580 --> 02:44:42,940
and I'll try and keep the answer short.

2313
02:44:42,940 --> 02:44:43,780
Thanks.

2314
02:44:43,780 --> 02:44:53,780
