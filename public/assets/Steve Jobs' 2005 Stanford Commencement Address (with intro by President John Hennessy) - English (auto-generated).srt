3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,400
it now gives me great pleasure to introduce this year's commencement

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,440
speaker Steve Jobs

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,989
the chief executive officer and co-founder of Apple and Pixar Animation

6
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:46,210
Studios Stanford University has been characterized since its founding by a

7
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,320
willingness to be bold and to strike out in new directions and this is a

8
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,470
characteristic very much shared by today's speaker a pioneer and visionary

9
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:02,440
for almost three decades his name and the companies he has founded have been

10
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,780
synonymous with innovation and creativity as a young boy growing up in

11
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:15,789
Los Altos Steve Jobs came of age at the same time as Silicon Valley while still

12
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:18,759
in school he attended lectures informally at

13
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:24,670
Stanford as well as at youlet Packard where he spent a summer working after

14
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:30,250
graduating from high school he left California to attend Reed College a trek

15
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:36,479
through India and a short stint as a video game designer for Atari followed

16
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:43,810
soon after his return to the valley in 1974 he became a regular along with

17
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:49,540
Steve Wozniak at meetings of the homebrew Computer Club held at the

18
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:55,329
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center it was not long before the two of them had

19
00:01:55,329 --> 00:02:01,439
built the prototype for the Apple one the Apple one was very fast at the time

20
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:08,579
reading and writing for kilobytes in about 20 seconds

21
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:17,230
about 20,000 times slower than we do so today the Apple 2 was faster still but

22
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:22,720
more importantly introduced color monitors into the home market in the

23
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,050
mid-1980s the Macintosh became the first truly user-friendly personal computer

24
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,720
you didn't have to be an expert to set it up or to load software or to transfer

25
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,160
information between applications and the mouse offered point-and-click

26
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:46,209
convenience and opened the door to computer literacy for everyone I still

27
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:52,870
remember the amazed faces of onlookers as they saw a computer that was

28
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:59,050
completely different from the personal computers of that day Steve also

29
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:04,360
co-founded Pixar Animation Studios which has revolutionized the film industry in

30
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,930
its short history with brilliant use of technology and produced two Academy

31
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:16,230
award-winning films Toy Story and Finding Nemo

32
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,420
since has returned to Apple eight years ago Steve has reinvented the company

33
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:32,269
once again extending its vision to music and new digital media iPod and iTunes

34
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:39,930
have changed the way we listen to organize store and purchase our music

35
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:47,040
and in my case the way I often read books now songs we love are just 99

36
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:54,170
cents and a completely legal click away

37
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:01,230
iPhoto and iMovie revolutionized the ability of consumers to organize edit

38
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,239
and display digital photography and video putting capabilities that once

39
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,900
cost thousands of dollars into the hands of every Mac user Steve is also widely

40
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,000
recognized for his ability to create an innovative environment inside Apple as

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,220
well as an external company image that is equally innovative just think about

42
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,229
Apple's marketing campaigns over the past three decades a promotional flyer

43
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:35,430
in 1976 showed Isaac Newton sitting under a tree just as an apple was

44
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:45,120
falling by with the catchy exhortation to bite B yte into an apple there was an

45
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:55,440
iconic Superbowl commercial techy humor an iconic Superbowl commercial telling

46
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,599
us that the Macintosh was on the horizon and assuring us that we would see why

47
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:09,389
1984 wouldn't be like 1984 and in the late 1990s we saw banners and billboards

48
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:15,810
featuring Pablo Picasso Albert Einstein Martha Graham and Mahatma Gandhi all

49
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:22,470
urging us to think different Steve Jobs understands the creativity and

50
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:28,469
innovation start by thinking differently he has a deep-rooted belief in the power

51
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:33,020
of Education to transform lives coupled with the desire to make the

52
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:38,600
world a better place from the earliest days of Apple he worked to develop

53
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:45,170
partnerships with educators and get computers into schools for almost three

54
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:49,790
decades he and his companies have provided invaluable technology and

55
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:55,280
supports to schools and communities increasing accessibility to information

56
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:03,080
for learners of all ages more than 100 years ago in describing his vision for a

57
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:09,770
new University leland stanford rode the imagination needs to be cultivated and

58
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:16,510
developed to assure success in life stanford clearly understood that

59
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:21,470
technical knowledge was only the starting point for creation and

60
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:27,110
discovery Steve Jobs understands that the computer is a very powerful tool in

61
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:33,020
a technical sense but that it's true power lies in the ability to unleash the

62
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:39,620
imagination and creativity of the user as he explained to the New York Times in

63
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:46,400
a 1997 interview the Macintosh turned out so well because the people working

64
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,450
on it were musicians artists poets and

65
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:57,680
historians who also happen to be excellent computer scientists and last

66
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:04,490
fall a Businessweek reporter asked how he manages for innovation his answer was

67
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:10,580
deceptively simple we hire people who want to make the best things in the

68
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:17,540
world Steve Jobs personifies the spirit and creativity that have characterized

69
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:23,990
this university since its founding 114 years ago and we are pleased to have him

70
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:28,040
here today please join me in warmly welcoming this year's commencement

71
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,360
speaker Steve Jobs

72
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:49,100
thank you I'm honored to be with you today for your commencement from one of

73
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,540
the finest universities in the world

74
00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:02,180
truth be told I never graduated from college and this is the closest I've

75
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,350
ever gotten to a college graduation

76
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:11,420
today I want to tell you three stories from my life that's it no big deal just

77
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:20,150
three stories the first story is about connecting the dots I dropped out of

78
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,350
Reed College after the first six months but then stayed around as a drop in for

79
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:31,520
another 18 months or so before I really quit so why did I drop out it started

80
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,610
before I was born my biological mother was a young unwed graduate student and

81
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,770
she decided to put me up for adoption she felt very strongly that I should be

82
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,850
adopted by college graduates so everything was all set for me to be

83
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:52,340
adopted at Birth by a lawyer and his wife except that when I popped out they

84
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:57,590
decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl so my parents who

85
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:02,420
were on a waiting list got a call in the middle of the night asking we've got an

86
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:10,550
unexpected baby boy he want him they said of course my biological mother

87
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,840
found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my

88
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,370
father had never graduated from high school she refused to sign the final

89
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:25,220
adoption papers she only relented a few months later when my parents promised

90
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:33,950
that I would go to college this was the start in my life and 17 years later I

91
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:39,410
did go to college but I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as

92
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:44,270
Stanford and all of my working-class parents savings were being spent on my

93
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:49,760
college tuition after six months I couldn't see the value in it I had no

94
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,840
idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to

95
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,010
help me figure it out and here I was spending all the money my parents had

96
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:04,070
saved their entire life so I decided to drop out and trust that it would all

97
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:09,440
work out okay it was pretty scary at the time but looking back it was one of the

98
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,650
best decisions I ever made the minute I dropped out I could stop taking the

99
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:20,660
required classes that didn't interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that

100
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:25,970
looked far more interesting it wasn't all romantic I didn't have a dorm room

101
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,770
so I slept on the floor in friends rooms I returned coke bottles for the five

102
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:35,210
cent deposits to buy food with and I would walk the seven miles across town

103
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:40,180
every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hari Krishna temple I

104
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:45,770
loved it and much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and

105
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:51,010
intuition turned out to be priceless later on let me give you one example

106
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:55,010
Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction

107
00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:00,620
in the country throughout the campus every poster every label on every drawer

108
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:05,720
was beautifully hand calligraphed because I had dropped out and didn't

109
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,100
have to take the normal classes I decided to take a calligraphy class to

110
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,450
learn how to do this I learned about serif and sans-serif typefaces about

111
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,620
varying the amount of space between different letter combinations about what

112
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:24,280
makes great typography great it was beautiful historical artistically

113
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:30,860
subtle in a way that science can't capture and I found it fascinating none

114
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:36,680
of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life but 10 years

115
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,090
later when we were designing the first Macintosh computer it all came back to

116
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:45,830
me and we designed it all into the Mac it was the first computer with beautiful

117
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:51,710
typography if I had never dropped in on that single course in college the Mac

118
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:56,240
would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts and since

119
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,840
windows just copied the Mac it's likely that no personal computer

120
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,000
if I had never dropped out I would have never dropped in on that calligraphy

121
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,750
class and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they

122
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,130
do of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I

123
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:24,690
was in college but it was very very clear looking backwards ten years later

124
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:29,520
again you can't connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them

125
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,050
looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in

126
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:38,430
your future you have to trust in something your gut destiny life karma

127
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:44,100
whatever because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you

128
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,570
the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path

129
00:12:48,570 --> 00:13:01,700
and that will make all the difference my second story is about love and loss I

130
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:08,010
was lucky I found what I loved to do early in life woz and I started Apple in

131
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:12,630
my parent's garage when I was 20 we worked hard and in 10 years Apple had

132
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,380
grown from just the two of us in a garage into a two billion dollar company

133
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:20,700
with over 4,000 employees we just released our finest creation the

134
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:27,780
Macintosh a year earlier and I just turned 30 and then I got fired how can

135
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:33,750
you get fired from a company you started well as Apple grew we hired someone who

136
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,680
I thought was very talented to run the company with me and for the first year

137
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,490
or so things went well but then our visions of the future began to diverge

138
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,410
and eventually we had a falling out when we did our Board of Directors sided with

139
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:52,650
him and so at 30 I was out and very publicly out what had been the focus of

140
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:57,750
my entire adult life was gone and it was devastating I really didn't know what to

141
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,530
do for a few months I felt that I had let the previous generation of

142
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:05,780
entrepreneurs down that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me I

143
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:11,220
met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so

144
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,600
badly I was a very public failure and I even

145
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,500
thought about running away from the valley but something slowly began to

146
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:25,040
dawn on me I still loved what I did the turn of events at Apple had not changed

147
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,250
that one bit I've been rejected but I was still in love and so I decided to

148
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:36,380
start over I didn't see it then but it turned out that getting fired from Apple

149
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,310
was the best thing that could have ever happened to me the heaviness of being

150
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,960
successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again less sure

151
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,620
about everything it freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my

152
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:53,060
life during the next five years I started a company named next another

153
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,450
company named Pixar and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become

154
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:00,800
my wife Pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated feature

155
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,240
film Toy Story and is now the most successful animation studio in the world

156
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:13,220
in a remarkable turn of events Apple bought next and I returned to Apple and

157
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,790
the technology we developed it next is at the heart of Apple's current

158
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:22,610
Renaissance and Laureen and I have a wonderful family together I'm pretty

159
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,880
sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple

160
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:31,130
it was awful tasting medicine but I guess the patient needed it sometime

161
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:35,090
life sometimes life's going to hit you in the head with a brick don't lose

162
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:39,500
faith I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what

163
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,720
I did you've got to find what you love and that is as true for work as it is

164
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,100
for your lovers your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the

165
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,540
only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work and the

166
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,430
only way to do great work is to love what you do if you haven't found it yet

167
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,980
keep looking and don't settle as with all matters of the heart you'll know

168
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,150
when you find it and like any great relationship it just gets better and

169
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:14,230
better as the years roll on so keep looking don't settle

170
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:29,820
my third story is about death when I was 17 I read a quote that went something

171
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:35,220
like if you live each day as if it was your last someday you'll most certainly

172
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:43,770
be right it made an impression on me and since then for the past 33 years I've

173
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:47,820
looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself if today were the last day

174
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:53,130
of my life what I want to do what I am about to do today and whenever the

175
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:58,310
answer has been no for too many days in a row I know I need to change something

176
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:02,610
remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever

177
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,780
encountered to help me make the big choices in life because almost

178
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:12,150
everything all external expectations all pride all fear of embarrassment or

179
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:17,190
failure these things just fall away in the face of death leaving only what is

180
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:22,589
truly important remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to

181
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:27,290
avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose you are already naked

182
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:34,470
there is no reason not to follow your heart about a year ago I was diagnosed

183
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,900
with cancer I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning and it clearly showed a tumor on

184
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:45,960
my pancreas I didn't even know what a pancreas was the doctors told me this

185
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,830
was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable and that I should

186
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:55,260
expect to live no longer than three to six months my doctor advised me to go

187
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:01,950
home and get my affairs in order which is doctors code for prepare to die it

188
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:06,450
means to try and tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the

189
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:11,340
next 10 years to tell them in just a few months it means to make sure everything

190
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,260
is buttoned up so that will be as easy as possible for your family it means to

191
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:23,250
say your goodbyes I live with that diagnosis all day later that evening I

192
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,330
had a biopsy where they stuck an endoscope down my throat through my

193
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:31,470
stomach and into my intestines put a needle into my pancreas and got a few

194
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:36,330
cells from the tumor I was sedated but my wife who was there

195
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:40,560
told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctor started

196
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,880
crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that

197
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:52,130
is curable with surgery I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now

198
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,860
this was the closest I've been to facing death and I hope it's the closest I get

199
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,630
for a few more decades having lived through it I can now say this to you

200
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,870
with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely

201
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:17,650
intellectual concept no one wants to die even people who want to go to heaven

202
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:22,900
don't want to die to get there and yet death is the destination we all

203
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:29,170
share no one has ever escaped it and that is as it should be because death is

204
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:35,140
very likely the single best invention of life its life's change agent it clears

205
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:41,230
out the old to make way for the new right now the new is you but some day

206
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:46,750
not too long from now you will gradually become the old and be cleared away sorry

207
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:53,320
to be so dramatic but it's quite true your time is limited so don't waste it

208
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,450
living someone else's life don't be trapped by Dogma which is living with

209
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,500
the results of other people's thinking don't let the noise of others opinions

210
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,600
drown out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow

211
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,549
your heart and intuition they somehow already know what you truly want to

212
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:17,790
become everything else is secondary

213
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:32,070
when I was young there was an amazing publication called the Whole Earth

214
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:37,350
Catalog which was one of the Bible's of my generation it was created by a fellow

215
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:42,059
named Stuart brand not far from here in Menlo Park and he brought it to life

216
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:46,950
with his poetic touch this was in the late 60s before personal computers and

217
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:51,240
desktop publishing so it was all made with typewriters scissors and Polaroid

218
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,549
cameras it was sort of like Google and paperback form 35 years before Google

219
00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:03,720
came along it was idealistic overflowing with neat tools and great notions Stuart

220
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,070
and his team put out several issues of the Whole Earth Catalog and then when it

221
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,620
had run its course they put out a final issue

222
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:18,240
it was the mid-1970s and I was your age on the back cover of their final issue

223
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,159
was a photograph of an early-morning country road the kind you might find

224
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:28,130
yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous beneath it were the words

225
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:35,309
stay hungry stay foolish it was their farewell message as they signed off stay

226
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:42,899
hungry stay foolish and I have always wished that for myself and now as you

227
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:50,159
graduate to begin anew I wish that for you stay hungry stay foolish thank you

228
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,610
all very much

229
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:56,179
you
