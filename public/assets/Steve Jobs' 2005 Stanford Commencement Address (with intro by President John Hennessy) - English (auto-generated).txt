it now gives me great pleasure to introduce this year's commencement

speaker Steve Jobs

the chief executive officer and co-founder of Apple and Pixar Animation

Studios Stanford University has been characterized since its founding by a

willingness to be bold and to strike out in new directions and this is a

characteristic very much shared by today's speaker a pioneer and visionary

for almost three decades his name and the companies he has founded have been

synonymous with innovation and creativity as a young boy growing up in

Los Altos Steve Jobs came of age at the same time as Silicon Valley while still

in school he attended lectures informally at

Stanford as well as at youlet Packard where he spent a summer working after

graduating from high school he left California to attend Reed College a trek

through India and a short stint as a video game designer for Atari followed

soon after his return to the valley in 1974 he became a regular along with

Steve Wozniak at meetings of the homebrew Computer Club held at the

Stanford Linear Accelerator Center it was not long before the two of them had

built the prototype for the Apple one the Apple one was very fast at the time

reading and writing for kilobytes in about 20 seconds

about 20,000 times slower than we do so today the Apple 2 was faster still but

more importantly introduced color monitors into the home market in the

mid-1980s the Macintosh became the first truly user-friendly personal computer

you didn't have to be an expert to set it up or to load software or to transfer

information between applications and the mouse offered point-and-click

convenience and opened the door to computer literacy for everyone I still

remember the amazed faces of onlookers as they saw a computer that was

completely different from the personal computers of that day Steve also

co-founded Pixar Animation Studios which has revolutionized the film industry in

its short history with brilliant use of technology and produced two Academy

award-winning films Toy Story and Finding Nemo

since has returned to Apple eight years ago Steve has reinvented the company

once again extending its vision to music and new digital media iPod and iTunes

have changed the way we listen to organize store and purchase our music

and in my case the way I often read books now songs we love are just 99

cents and a completely legal click away

iPhoto and iMovie revolutionized the ability of consumers to organize edit

and display digital photography and video putting capabilities that once

cost thousands of dollars into the hands of every Mac user Steve is also widely

recognized for his ability to create an innovative environment inside Apple as

well as an external company image that is equally innovative just think about

Apple's marketing campaigns over the past three decades a promotional flyer

in 1976 showed Isaac Newton sitting under a tree just as an apple was

falling by with the catchy exhortation to bite B yte into an apple there was an

iconic Superbowl commercial techy humor an iconic Superbowl commercial telling

us that the Macintosh was on the horizon and assuring us that we would see why

1984 wouldn't be like 1984 and in the late 1990s we saw banners and billboards

featuring Pablo Picasso Albert Einstein Martha Graham and Mahatma Gandhi all

urging us to think different Steve Jobs understands the creativity and

innovation start by thinking differently he has a deep-rooted belief in the power

of Education to transform lives coupled with the desire to make the

world a better place from the earliest days of Apple he worked to develop

partnerships with educators and get computers into schools for almost three

decades he and his companies have provided invaluable technology and

supports to schools and communities increasing accessibility to information

for learners of all ages more than 100 years ago in describing his vision for a

new University leland stanford rode the imagination needs to be cultivated and

developed to assure success in life stanford clearly understood that

technical knowledge was only the starting point for creation and

discovery Steve Jobs understands that the computer is a very powerful tool in

a technical sense but that it's true power lies in the ability to unleash the

imagination and creativity of the user as he explained to the New York Times in

a 1997 interview the Macintosh turned out so well because the people working

on it were musicians artists poets and

historians who also happen to be excellent computer scientists and last

fall a Businessweek reporter asked how he manages for innovation his answer was

deceptively simple we hire people who want to make the best things in the

world Steve Jobs personifies the spirit and creativity that have characterized

this university since its founding 114 years ago and we are pleased to have him

here today please join me in warmly welcoming this year's commencement

speaker Steve Jobs

thank you I'm honored to be with you today for your commencement from one of

the finest universities in the world

truth be told I never graduated from college and this is the closest I've

ever gotten to a college graduation

today I want to tell you three stories from my life that's it no big deal just

three stories the first story is about connecting the dots I dropped out of

Reed College after the first six months but then stayed around as a drop in for

another 18 months or so before I really quit so why did I drop out it started

before I was born my biological mother was a young unwed graduate student and

she decided to put me up for adoption she felt very strongly that I should be

adopted by college graduates so everything was all set for me to be

adopted at Birth by a lawyer and his wife except that when I popped out they

decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl so my parents who

were on a waiting list got a call in the middle of the night asking we've got an

unexpected baby boy he want him they said of course my biological mother

found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my

father had never graduated from high school she refused to sign the final

adoption papers she only relented a few months later when my parents promised

that I would go to college this was the start in my life and 17 years later I

did go to college but I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as

Stanford and all of my working-class parents savings were being spent on my

college tuition after six months I couldn't see the value in it I had no

idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to

help me figure it out and here I was spending all the money my parents had

saved their entire life so I decided to drop out and trust that it would all

work out okay it was pretty scary at the time but looking back it was one of the

best decisions I ever made the minute I dropped out I could stop taking the

required classes that didn't interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that

looked far more interesting it wasn't all romantic I didn't have a dorm room

so I slept on the floor in friends rooms I returned coke bottles for the five

cent deposits to buy food with and I would walk the seven miles across town

every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hari Krishna temple I

loved it and much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and

intuition turned out to be priceless later on let me give you one example

Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction

in the country throughout the campus every poster every label on every drawer

was beautifully hand calligraphed because I had dropped out and didn't

have to take the normal classes I decided to take a calligraphy class to

learn how to do this I learned about serif and sans-serif typefaces about

varying the amount of space between different letter combinations about what

makes great typography great it was beautiful historical artistically

subtle in a way that science can't capture and I found it fascinating none

of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life but 10 years

later when we were designing the first Macintosh computer it all came back to

me and we designed it all into the Mac it was the first computer with beautiful

typography if I had never dropped in on that single course in college the Mac

would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts and since

windows just copied the Mac it's likely that no personal computer

if I had never dropped out I would have never dropped in on that calligraphy

class and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they

do of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I

was in college but it was very very clear looking backwards ten years later

again you can't connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them

looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in

your future you have to trust in something your gut destiny life karma

whatever because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you

the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path

and that will make all the difference my second story is about love and loss I

was lucky I found what I loved to do early in life woz and I started Apple in

my parent's garage when I was 20 we worked hard and in 10 years Apple had

grown from just the two of us in a garage into a two billion dollar company

with over 4,000 employees we just released our finest creation the

Macintosh a year earlier and I just turned 30 and then I got fired how can

you get fired from a company you started well as Apple grew we hired someone who

I thought was very talented to run the company with me and for the first year

or so things went well but then our visions of the future began to diverge

and eventually we had a falling out when we did our Board of Directors sided with

him and so at 30 I was out and very publicly out what had been the focus of

my entire adult life was gone and it was devastating I really didn't know what to

do for a few months I felt that I had let the previous generation of

entrepreneurs down that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me I

met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so

badly I was a very public failure and I even

thought about running away from the valley but something slowly began to

dawn on me I still loved what I did the turn of events at Apple had not changed

that one bit I've been rejected but I was still in love and so I decided to

start over I didn't see it then but it turned out that getting fired from Apple

was the best thing that could have ever happened to me the heaviness of being

successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again less sure

about everything it freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my

life during the next five years I started a company named next another

company named Pixar and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become

my wife Pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated feature

film Toy Story and is now the most successful animation studio in the world

in a remarkable turn of events Apple bought next and I returned to Apple and

the technology we developed it next is at the heart of Apple's current

Renaissance and Laureen and I have a wonderful family together I'm pretty

sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple

it was awful tasting medicine but I guess the patient needed it sometime

life sometimes life's going to hit you in the head with a brick don't lose

faith I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what

I did you've got to find what you love and that is as true for work as it is

for your lovers your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the

only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work and the

only way to do great work is to love what you do if you haven't found it yet

keep looking and don't settle as with all matters of the heart you'll know

when you find it and like any great relationship it just gets better and

better as the years roll on so keep looking don't settle

my third story is about death when I was 17 I read a quote that went something

like if you live each day as if it was your last someday you'll most certainly

be right it made an impression on me and since then for the past 33 years I've

looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself if today were the last day

of my life what I want to do what I am about to do today and whenever the

answer has been no for too many days in a row I know I need to change something

remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever

encountered to help me make the big choices in life because almost

everything all external expectations all pride all fear of embarrassment or

failure these things just fall away in the face of death leaving only what is

truly important remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to

avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose you are already naked

there is no reason not to follow your heart about a year ago I was diagnosed

with cancer I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning and it clearly showed a tumor on

my pancreas I didn't even know what a pancreas was the doctors told me this

was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable and that I should

expect to live no longer than three to six months my doctor advised me to go

home and get my affairs in order which is doctors code for prepare to die it

means to try and tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the

next 10 years to tell them in just a few months it means to make sure everything

is buttoned up so that will be as easy as possible for your family it means to

say your goodbyes I live with that diagnosis all day later that evening I

had a biopsy where they stuck an endoscope down my throat through my

stomach and into my intestines put a needle into my pancreas and got a few

cells from the tumor I was sedated but my wife who was there

told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctor started

crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that

is curable with surgery I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now

this was the closest I've been to facing death and I hope it's the closest I get

for a few more decades having lived through it I can now say this to you

with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely

intellectual concept no one wants to die even people who want to go to heaven

don't want to die to get there and yet death is the destination we all

share no one has ever escaped it and that is as it should be because death is

very likely the single best invention of life its life's change agent it clears

out the old to make way for the new right now the new is you but some day

not too long from now you will gradually become the old and be cleared away sorry

to be so dramatic but it's quite true your time is limited so don't waste it

living someone else's life don't be trapped by Dogma which is living with

the results of other people's thinking don't let the noise of others opinions

drown out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow

your heart and intuition they somehow already know what you truly want to

become everything else is secondary

when I was young there was an amazing publication called the Whole Earth

Catalog which was one of the Bible's of my generation it was created by a fellow

named Stuart brand not far from here in Menlo Park and he brought it to life

with his poetic touch this was in the late 60s before personal computers and

desktop publishing so it was all made with typewriters scissors and Polaroid

cameras it was sort of like Google and paperback form 35 years before Google

came along it was idealistic overflowing with neat tools and great notions Stuart

and his team put out several issues of the Whole Earth Catalog and then when it

had run its course they put out a final issue

it was the mid-1970s and I was your age on the back cover of their final issue

was a photograph of an early-morning country road the kind you might find

yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous beneath it were the words

stay hungry stay foolish it was their farewell message as they signed off stay

hungry stay foolish and I have always wished that for myself and now as you

graduate to begin anew I wish that for you stay hungry stay foolish thank you

all very much

you
